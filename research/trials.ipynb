This hand-\\nbook introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot train-\\ning. Except for the Code of Federal Regulations pertinent to civil aviation, most of the knowledge areas applicable\\nto pilot certification are presented. This handbook is useful to beginning pilots, as well as those pursuing more\\nadvanced pilot certificates.\\nOccasionally, the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of\\nsuch language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal\\nRegulations (14 CFR).\\nIt is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR\\nand the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).\\nThe current Flight Standards Service airman training and testing material and subject matter knowledge codes for all\\nairman certificates and ratings can be obtained from the Flight Standards Service Web site at http://av-info.faa.gov.\\nThis handbook supersedes Advisory Circular (AC) 61-23C, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, dated\\n1997.\\nThis publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO),\\nWashington, DC 20402-9325, or from http://bookstore.gpo.gov.\\nThis handbook is published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Airman\\nTesting Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125. Comments regarding this hand-\\nbook should be sent in e-mail form to AFS630comments@faa.gov.\\nAC 00-2, Advisory Circular Checklist, transmits the current status of FAA advisory circulars and \\nother flight information and publications.

In addition, the fuselage may also\\nprovide room for cargo and attachment points for the\\nother major airplane components. Some aircraft uti-\\nlize an open truss structure. The truss-type fuselage is\\nconstructed of steel or aluminum tubing. Strength and\\nrigidity is achieved by welding the tubing together\\ninto a series of triangular shapes, called trusses.\\n[Figure 1-2]\\nConstruction of the Warren truss features longerons,\\nas well as diagonal and vertical web members. To\\nreduce weight, small airplanes generally utilize \\naluminum alloy tubing, which may be riveted or\\nbolted into one piece with cross-bracing members.\\nAs technology progressed, aircraft designers began to\\nenclose the truss members to streamline the airplane\\nand improve performance. This was originally accom-\\nplished with cloth fabric, which eventually gave way to\\nlightweight metals such as aluminum. In some cases,\\nthe outside skin can support all or a major portion of\\nthe flight loads. Most modern aircraft use a form of this\\nstressed skin structure known as monocoque or semi-\\nmonocoque construction.\\nThe monocoque design uses stressed skin to support\\nalmost all imposed loads. This structure can be very\\nstrong but cannot tolerate dents or deformation of the\\nsurface. This characteristic is easily demonstrated by a\\nthin aluminum beverage can. You can exert considerable\\nforce to the ends of the can without causing any damage.\\nHowever, if the side of the can is dented only slightly,\\nthe can will collapse easily. The true monocoque con-\\nstruction mainly consists of the skin, formers, and\\nbulkheads. The formers and bulkheads provide shape\\nfor the fuselage. [Figure 1-3]\\nSince no bracing members are present, the skin must be\\nstrong enough to keep the fuselage rigid. Thus, a \\nsignificant problem involved in monocoque construc-\\ntion is maintaining enough strength while keeping the\\nweight within allowable limits. Due to the limitations of\\nthe monocoque design, a semi-monocoque structure is\\nused on many of today’s aircraft.\\nThe semi-monocoque system uses a substructure to\\nwhich the airplane’s skin is attached. The substructure,\\nwhich consists of bulkheads and/or formers of various\\nsizes and stringers, reinforces the stressed skin by \\ntaking some of the bending stress from the fuselage.\\nThe main section of the fuselage also includes wing\\nattachment points and a firewall.

There is a fireproof\\npartition between the rear of the engine and the cockpit\\nor cabin to protect the pilot and passengers from \\naccidental engine fires. This partition is called a \\nfirewall and is usually made of heat-resistant material\\nsuch as stainless steel.\\nWINGS\\nThe wings are airfoils attached to each side of the \\nfuselage and are the main lifting surfaces that support\\nthe airplane in flight. There are numerous wing\\ndesigns, sizes, and shapes used by the various manu-\\nfacturers. Each fulfills a certain need with respect to\\nthe expected performance for the particular airplane.\\nHow the wing produces lift is explained in subsequent\\nchapters.\\nWings may be attached at the top, middle, or lower por-\\ntion of the fuselage. These designs are referred to as\\nhigh-, mid-, and low-wing, respectively. The number of\\nwings can also vary. Airplanes with a single set of\\nwings are referred to as monoplanes, while those with\\ntwo sets are called biplanes. [Figure 1-5]\\nMany high-wing airplanes have external braces, or\\nwing struts, which transmit the flight and landing loads\\nthrough the struts to the main fuselage structure. Since\\nthe wing struts are usually attached approximately\\nhalfway out on the wing, this type of wing structure is\\ncalled semi-cantilever. A few high-wing and most \\nlow-wing airplanes have a full cantilever wing\\ndesigned to carry the loads without external struts.\\nThe principal structural parts of the wing are spars,\\nribs, and stringers. [Figure 1-6] These are reinforced by\\nAirfoil—An airfoil is any surface, such as a wing, propeller, rudder, or\\neven a trim tab, which provides aerodynamic force when it interacts\\nwith a moving stream of air.\\nMonoplane—An airplane that has only one main lifting surface or\\nwing, usually divided into two parts by the fuselage.\\nBiplane—An airplane that has two main airfoil surfaces or wings on\\neach side of the fuselage, one placed above the other.\\nFigure 1-5.

The wing ribs determine the shape and thickness\\nof the wing (airfoil). In most modern airplanes, the fuel\\ntanks either are an integral part of the wing’s structure,\\nor consist of flexible containers mounted inside of the\\nwing.\\nAttached to the rear, or trailing, edges of the wings are\\ntwo types of control surfaces referred to as ailerons and\\nflaps. Ailerons extend from about the midpoint of each\\nwing outward toward the tip and move in opposite\\ndirections to create aerodynamic forces that cause the\\nairplane to roll. Flaps extend outward from the \\nfuselage to near the midpoint of each wing. The flaps\\nare normally flush with the wing’s surface during \\ncruising flight. When extended, the flaps move simul-\\ntaneously downward to increase the lifting force of the\\nwing for takeoffs and landings.\\nEMPENNAGE\\nThe correct name for the tail section of an airplane is\\nempennage. The empennage includes the entire tail\\ngroup, consisting of fixed surfaces such as the vertical\\nstabilizer and the horizontal stabilizer. The movable sur-\\nfaces include the rudder, the elevator, and one or more\\ntrim tabs. [Figure 1-7]\\nA second type of empennage design does not require\\nan elevator. Instead, it incorporates a one-piece hori-\\nzontal stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point.\\nThis type of design is called a stabilator, and is moved\\nusing the control wheel, just as you would the eleva-\\ntor. For example, when you pull back on the control\\nwheel, the stabilator pivots so the trailing edge moves\\nup. This increases the aerodynamic tail load and\\ncauses the nose of the airplane to move up. Stabilators\\nhave an antiservo tab extending across their trailing\\nedge. [Figure 1-8]\\nThe antiservo tab moves in the same direction as the\\ntrailing edge of the stabilator. The antiservo tab also\\nfunctions as a trim tab to relieve control pressures and\\nhelps maintain the stabilator in the desired position.\\nThe rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabi-\\nlizer. During flight, it is used to move the airplane’s\\nnose left and right. The rudder is used in combination\\nwith the ailerons for turns during flight. The elevator,\\nwhich is attached to the back of the horizontal stabi-\\nlizer, is used to move the nose of the airplane up and\\ndown during flight.\\nTrim tabs are small, movable portions of the trailing\\nedge of the control surface. These movable trim tabs,\\nwhich are controlled from the cockpit, reduce control\\npressures. Trim tabs may be installed on the ailerons,\\nthe rudder, and/or the elevator.\\nLANDING GEAR\\nThe landing gear is the principle support of the airplane\\nwhen parked, taxiing, taking off, or when landing.

[Figure 1-9]\\nThe landing gear consists of three wheels—two main\\nwheels and a third wheel positioned either at the front or\\nrear of the airplane. Landing gear employing a rear-\\nmounted wheel is called conventional landing gear.\\nAirplanes with conventional landing gear are sometimes\\nreferred to as tailwheel airplanes. When the third wheel is\\nlocated on the nose, it is called a nosewheel, and the\\ndesign is referred to as a tricycle gear. A steerable nose-\\nwheel or tailwheel permits the airplane to be controlled\\nthroughout all operations while on the ground.\\nTHE POWERPLANT\\nThe powerplant usually includes both the engine and\\nthe propeller. The primary function of the engine is to\\nprovide the power to turn the propeller. It also gener-\\nates electrical power, provides a vacuum source for\\nsome flight instruments, and in most single-engine\\nairplanes, provides a source of heat for the pilot and\\npassengers. The engine is covered by a cowling, or in\\nthe case of some airplanes, surrounded by a nacelle.\\nThe purpose of the cowling or nacelle is to stream-\\nline the flow of air around the engine and to help cool\\nthe engine by ducting air around the cylinders. The\\npropeller, mounted on the front of the engine, trans-\\nlates the rotating force of the engine into a forward-\\nacting force called thrust that helps move the airplane\\nthrough the air.

To\\ncompetently control the airplane, the pilot must\\nunderstand the principles involved and learn to utilize\\nor counteract these natural forces.\\nModern general aviation airplanes have what may\\nbe considered high performance characteristics.\\nTherefore, it is increasingly necessary that pilots\\nappreciate and understand the principles upon which\\nthe art of flying is based.\\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE\\nThe atmosphere in which flight is conducted is an\\nenvelope of air that surrounds the earth and rests\\nupon its surface. It is as much a part of the earth as\\nthe seas or the land. However, air differs from land\\nand water inasmuch as it is a mixture of gases. It has\\nmass, weight, and indefinite shape.\\nAir, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its\\nshape when subjected to even minute pressures because\\nof the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example,\\ngas will completely fill any container into which it is\\nplaced, expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to\\nthe limits of the container.\\nThe atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21\\npercent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as\\nargon or helium. As some of these elements are heavier\\nthan others, there is a natural tendency of these heavier\\nelements, such as oxygen, to settle to the surface of the\\nearth, while the lighter elements are lifted up to the\\nregion of higher altitude.

For this\\nreason, the weight of the atmosphere at 18,000 feet\\nis only one-half what it is at sea level. [Figure 2-1]\\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nThough there are various kinds of pressure, this\\ndiscussion is mainly concerned with atmospheric\\npressure. It is one of the basic factors in weather\\nchanges, helps to lift the airplane, and actuates some\\nof the important flight instruments in the airplane.\\nThese instruments are the altimeter, the airspeed\\nindicator, the rate-of-climb indicator, and the\\nmanifold pressure gauge.\\nThough air is very light, it has mass and is affected\\nby the attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other\\nsubstance, it has weight, and because of its weight, it\\nhas force. Since it is a fluid substance, this force is\\nexerted equally in all directions, and its effect on\\nbodies within the air is called pressure. Under\\nstandard conditions at sea level, the average pressure\\nexerted on the human body by the weight of the\\natmosphere around it is approximately 14.7 lb./in.\\nThe density of air has significant effects on the\\nairplane’s capability. As air becomes less dense, it\\nreduces (1) power because the engine takes in less\\nair, (2) thrust because the propeller is less efficient in\\nthin air, and (3) lift because the thin air exerts less\\nforce on the airfoils.\\nEFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON DENSITY\\nSince air is a gas, it can be compressed or expanded.\\nWhen air is compressed, a greater amount of air can\\noccupy a given volume. Conversely, when pressure\\non a given volume of air is decreased, the air\\nexpands and occupies a greater space. That is, the\\noriginal column of air at a lower pressure contains a\\nsmaller mass of air. In other words, the density is\\ndecreased. In fact, density is directly proportional to\\npressure. If the pressure is doubled, the density is\\ndoubled, and if the pressure is lowered, so is the\\ndensity. This statement is true, only at a\\nconstant temperature.\\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON DENSITY\\nThe effect of increasing the temperature of a\\nsubstance is to decrease its density. Conversely,\\ndecreasing the temperature has the effect of\\nincreasing the density. Thus, the density of air varies\\ninversely as the absolute temperature varies. This\\nstatement is true, only at a constant pressure.\\nIn the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure\\ndecrease with altitude, and have conflicting effects\\nupon density. However, the fairly rapid drop in\\npressure as altitude is increased usually has the\\ndominating effect. Hence, density can be expected to\\ndecrease with altitude.\\nEFFECT OF HUMIDITY ON DENSITY\\nThe preceding paragraphs have assumed that the air\\nwas perfectly dry. In reality, it is never completely\\ndry. The small amount of water vapor suspended in\\nthe atmosphere may be almost negligible under\\ncertain conditions, but in other conditions humidity\\nmay become an important factor in the performance\\nof an airplane. Water vapor is lighter than air;\\nconsequently, moist air is lighter than dry air. It is\\nlightest or least dense when, in a given set of\\nconditions, it contains the maximum amount of\\nwater vapor. The higher the temperature, the greater\\namount of water vapor the air can hold. When\\ncomparing two separate air masses, the first warm\\nand moist (both qualities tending to lighten the air)\\nand the second cold and dry (both qualities making it\\nheavier), the first necessarily must be less dense than\\nthe second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity\\nhave a great influence on airplane performance,\\nbecause of their effect upon density.\\nNEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION AND\\nFORCE\\nIn the 17th century, a philosopher and\\nmathematician, Sir Isaac Newton, propounded three\\nbasic laws of motion. It is certain that he did not have\\nthe airplane in mind when he did so, but almost\\neverything known about motion goes back to his\\nthree simple laws. These laws, named after Newton,\\nare as follows:\\nNewton’s first law states, in part, that: A body at rest\\ntends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to\\n29.92 30\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n  5\\n  0\\nInches of Mercury\\nAtmospheric\\nPressure\\nStandard\\nSea Level\\nPressure\\nFigure 2-1.

An airplane at rest on the ramp will remain at rest\\nunless a force strong enough to overcome its inertia is\\napplied. Once it is moving, however, its inertia keeps it\\nmoving, subject to the various other forces acting on it.\\nThese forces may add to its motion, slow it down, or\\nchange its direction.\\nNewton’s second law implies that: When a body is\\nacted upon by a constant force, its resulting\\nacceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the\\nbody and is directly proportional to the applied force.\\nWhat is being dealt with here are the factors involved\\nin overcoming Newton’s First Law of Inertia. It covers\\nboth changes in direction and speed, including starting\\nup from rest (positive acceleration) and coming to a\\nstop (negative acceleration, or deceleration).\\nNewton’s third law states that: Whenever one body\\nexerts a force on another, the second body always\\nexerts on the first, a force that is equal in magnitude but\\nopposite in direction.\\nThe recoil of a gun as it is fired is a graphic example of\\nNewton’s third law. The champion swimmer who\\npushes against the side of the pool during the\\nturnaround, or the infant learning to walk—both would\\nfail but for the phenomena expressed in this law. In an\\nairplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the air;\\nconsequently, the air pushes the propeller (and thus the\\nairplane) in\\nthe opposite direction—forward. In a jet\\nairplane, the engine pushes a blast of hot gases\\nbackward; the force of equal and opposite reaction\\npushes against the engine and forces the airplane\\nforward. The movement of all vehicles is a graphic\\nillustration of Newton’s third law.\\nMAGNUS EFFECT\\nThe explanation of lift can best be explained by looking\\nat a cylinder rotating in an airstream. The local velocity\\nnear the cylinder is composed of the airstream velocity\\nand the cylinder’s rotational velocity, which decreases\\nwith distance from the cylinder. On a cylinder, which is\\nrotating in such a way that the top surface area is rotating\\nin the same direction as the airflow, the local velocity at\\nthe surface is high on top and low on the bottom.\\nAs shown in figure 2-2, at point “A,” a stagnation point\\nexists where the airstream line that impinges on the\\nsurface splits; some air goes over and some under.\\nAnother stagnation point exists at “B,” where the two\\nairstreams rejoin and resume at identical velocities. We\\nnow have upwash ahead of the rotating cylinder and\\ndownwash at the rear.\\nThe difference in surface velocity accounts for a differ-\\nence in pressure, with the pressure being lower on the\\ntop than the bottom. This low pressure area produces an\\nupward force known as the “Magnus Effect.” This\\nmechanically induced circulation illustrates the\\nrelationship between circulation and lift.\\nAn airfoil with a positive angle of attack develops air\\ncirculation as its sharp trailing edge forces the rear\\nstagnation point to be aft of the trailing edge, while the\\nfront stagnation point is below the leading edge.\\n[Figure 2-3]\\nBERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE OF\\nPRESSURE\\nA half century after Sir Newton presented his laws,\\nMr. Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician,\\nexplained how the pressure of a moving fluid (liquid\\nor gas) varies with its speed of motion.

This is exactly what happens to air passing\\nover the curved top of the airplane wing.\\nAn appropriate analogy can be made with water\\nflowing through a garden hose. Water moving through\\na hose of constant diameter exerts a uniform pressure\\non the hose; but if the diameter of a section of the hose\\nis increased or decreased, it is certain to change the\\npressure of the water at that point. Suppose the hose\\nwas pinched, thereby constricting the area through\\nwhich the water flows. Assuming that the same volume\\nof water flows through the constricted portion of the\\nhose in the same period of time as before the hose was\\npinched, it follows that the speed of flow must increase\\nat that point.\\nTherefore, if a portion of the hose is constricted, it not\\nonly increases the speed of the flow, but also decreases\\nthe pressure at that point. Like results could be\\nachieved if streamlined solids (airfoils) were\\nintroduced at the same point in the hose. This same\\nprinciple is the basis for the measurement of airspeed\\n(fluid flow) and for analyzing the airfoil’s ability to\\nproduce lift.\\nA practical application of Bernoulli’s theorem is the\\nventuri tube. The venturi tube has an air inlet which\\nnarrows to a throat (constricted point) and an outlet\\nsection which increases in diameter \\ntoward the rear.\\nThe diameter of the outlet is the same as that of the\\ninlet. At the throat, the airflow speeds up and the\\npressure decreases; at the outlet, the airflow slows\\nand the pressure increases. [Figure 2-4]\\nIf air is recognized as a body and it is accepted that it\\nmust follow the above laws, one can begin to see\\nhow and why an airplane wing develops lift as it\\nmoves through the air.\\nAIRFOIL DESIGN\\nIn the sections devoted to Newton’s and Bernoulli’s\\ndiscoveries, it has already been discussed in general\\nterms the question of how an airplane wing can\\nsustain flight when the airplane is heavier than air.\\nPerhaps the explanation can best be reduced to its\\nmost elementary concept by stating that lift (flight)\\nis simply the result of fluid flow (air) about an\\nairfoil—or in everyday language, the result of\\nmoving an airfoil (wing), by whatever means,\\nthrough the air.\\nSince it is the airfoil which harnesses the force\\ndeveloped by its movement through the air, a\\ndiscussion and explanation of this structure, as well as\\nsome of the material presented in previous discussions\\non Newton’s and Bernoulli’s laws, will be presented.\\nAn airfoil is a structure designed to obtain reaction\\nupon its surface from the air through which it moves or\\nthat moves past such a structure. Air acts in various\\nways when submitted to different pressures and\\nvelocities; but this discussion will be confined to the\\nparts of an airplane that a pilot is most concerned with\\nin flight—namely, the airfoils designed to produce lift.\\nBy looking at a typical airfoil profile, such as the cross\\nsection of a wing, one can see several obvious\\ncharacteristics of design. [Figure 2-5] Notice that there\\nis a difference in the curvatures of the upper and lower\\nsurfaces of the airfoil (the curvature is called camber).\\nThe camber of the upper surface is more pronounced\\nthan that of the lower surface, which is somewhat flat\\nin most instances.\\nIn figu\\nre 2-5, note that the two extremities of the\\nairfoil profile also differ in appearance.

The distance from this chord line to the upper\\nand lower surfaces of the wing denotes the magnitude\\nof the upper and lower camber at any point. Another\\nreference line, drawn from the leading edge to the\\ntrailing edge, is the “mean camber line.” This mean line\\nis equidistant at all points from the upper and\\nlower contours.\\nThe construction of the wing, so as to provide actions\\ngreater than its weight, is done by shaping the wing so\\nthat advantage can be taken of the air’s response to\\ncertain physical laws, and thus develop two actions\\nfrom the air mass; a positive pressure lifting action\\nfrom the air mass below the wing, and a negative\\npressure lifting action from lowered pressure above the\\nwing.\\nAs the airstream strikes the relatively flat lower surface\\nof the wing when inclined at a small a\\nngle to its\\ndirection of motion, the air is forced to rebound\\ndownward and therefore causes an upward reaction\\nin positive lift, while at the same time airstream\\nstriking the upper curved section of the “leading\\nedge” of the wing is deflected upward. In other\\nwords, a wing shaped to cause an action on the air,\\nand forcing it downward, will provide an equal\\nreaction from the air, forcing the wing upward. If a\\nwing is constructed in such form that it will cause a\\nlift force greater than the weight of the airplane, the\\nairplane will fly.\\nHowever, if all the lift required were obtained merely\\nfrom the deflection of air by the lower surface of the\\nwing, an airplane would need only a flat wing like a\\nkite. This, of course, is not the case at all; under certain\\nconditions disturbed air currents circulating at the\\ntrailing edge of the wing could be so excessive as to\\nmake the airplane lose speed and lift. The balance of\\nthe lift needed to support the airplane comes from the\\nflow of air above the wing. Herein lies the key to flight.\\nThe fact that most lift is the result of the airflow’s\\ndownwash from above the wing, must be thoroughly\\nunderstood in order to continue further in the study of\\nflight. It is neither accurate nor does it serve a useful\\npurpose, however, to assign specific values to the\\npercentage of lift generated by the upper surface of an\\nairfoil versus that generated by the lower surface.\\nThese are not constant values and will vary, not only\\nwith flight conditions, but with different wing designs.\\nIt should be understood that different airfoils have\\ndifferent flight characteristics. Many thousands of\\nairfoils have been tested in wind tunnels and in actual\\nflight, but no one airfoil has been found t\\nhat satisfies\\nevery flight requirement. The weight, speed, and\\npurpose of each airplane dictate the shape of its\\nairfoil. It was learned many years ago that the most\\nefficient airfoil for producing the greatest lift was\\none that had a concave, or “scooped out” lower\\nsurface. Later it was also learned that as a fixed\\ndesign, this type of airfoil sacrificed too much speed\\nwhile producing lift and, therefore, was not suitable\\nfor high-speed flight. It is interesting to note,\\nhowever, that through advanced progress in\\nengineering, today’s high-speed jets can again take\\nadvantage of the concave airfoil’s high lift\\ncharacteristics. Leading edge (Kreuger) flaps and\\ntrailing edge (Fowler) flaps, when extended from the\\nbasic wing structure, literally change the\\nairfoil shape into the classic concave form,\\nthereby generating much greater lift during slow\\nflight conditions.\\nOn the other hand, an airfoil that is perfectly\\nstreamlined and offers little wind resistance\\nsometimes does not have enough lifting power to\\ntake the airplane off the ground. Thus, modern\\nairplanes have airfoils which strike a medium\\nbetween extremes in design, the shape varying\\naccording to the needs of the airplane for which it is\\ndesigned. Figure 2-6 shows some of the more\\ncommon airfoil sections.\\nLOW PRESSURE ABOVE\\nIn a wind tunnel or in flight, an airfoil is simply a\\nstreamlined object inserted into a moving stream of\\nair. If the airfoil profile were in the shape of a\\nteardrop, the speed and the pressure changes of the\\nair passing over the top and bottom would be the\\nsame on both sides. But if the teardrop shaped airfoil\\nwere cut in half lengthwise, a form resembling the\\nbasic airfoil (wing) section would result. If the\\nairfoil were then inclined so the airflow strikes it at\\nan angle (angle of attack), the air molecules moving\\nover the upper surface would be forced to move\\nfaster than would the molecules moving along the\\nbottom of the airfoil, since the upper molecules must\\ntravel a greater distance due to the curvature of the\\nupper surface.

A discussion of the influence of\\nmomentum of the air as it flows in various curved\\npaths near the airfoil will be presented. [Figure 2-7]\\nMomentum is the resistance a moving body offers to\\nhaving its direction or amount of motion changed.\\nWhen a body is forced to move in a circular path, it\\noffers resistance in the direction away from the\\ncenter of the curved path. This is “centrifugal force.”\\nWhile the particles of air move in the curved path\\nAB, centrifugal force tends to throw them in the\\ndirection of the arrows between A and B and hence,\\ncauses the air to exert more than normal pressure on\\nthe leading edge of the airfoil. But after the air\\nparticles pass B (the point of reversal of the\\ncurvature of the path) the centrifugal force tends to\\nthrow them in the direction of the arrows between B\\nand C (causing reduced pressure on the airfoil). This\\neffect is held until the particles reach C, the second\\npoint of reversal of curvature of the airflow. Again\\nthe centrifugal force is reversed and the particles\\nmay even tend to give slightly more than normal\\npressure on the trailing edge of the airfoil, as\\nindicated by the short arrows between C and D.\\nTherefore, the air pressure on the upper surface of\\nthe airfoil is distributed so that the pressure is much\\ngreater on the leading edge than the surrounding\\natmospheric pressure, causing strong resistance to\\nforward motion; but the air pressure is less than\\nsurrounding atmospheric pressure over a large\\nportion of the top surface (B to C).\\nAs seen in the application of Bernoulli’s theorem to a\\nventuri, the speedup of air on the top of an airfoil\\nproduces a drop in pressure. This lowered pressure is a\\ncomponent of total lift. It is a mistake, however, to\\nassume that the pressure difference between the upper\\nand lower surface of a wing alone accounts for the total\\nlift force produced.\\nOne must also bear in mind that associated with the\\nlowered pressure is downwash; a downward backward\\nflow from the top surface of the wing. As already seen\\nfrom previous discussions r\\nelative to the dynamic\\naction of the air as it strikes the lower surface of the\\nwing, the reaction of this downward backward flow\\nresults in an upward forward force on the wing. This\\nsame reaction applies to the flow of air over the top\\nof the airfoil as well as to the bottom, and Newton’s\\nthird law is again in the picture.\\nHIGH PRESSURE BELOW\\nIn the section dealing with Newton’s laws as they\\napply to lift, it has already been discussed how a\\ncertain amount of lift is generated by pressure\\nconditions underneath the wing. Because of the\\nmanner in which air flows underneath the wing, a\\npositive pressure results, particularly at higher\\nangles of attack. But there is another aspect to this\\nairflow that must be considered. At a point close to\\nthe leading edge, the airflow is virtually stopped\\n(stagnation point) and then gradually increases\\nspeed. At some point near the trailing edge, it has\\nagain reached a velocity equal to that on the upper\\nsurface. In conformance with Bernoulli’s principles,\\nwhere the airflow was slowed beneath the wing, a\\npositive upward pressure was created against the\\nwing; i.e., as the fluid speed decreases, the pressure\\nmust increase. In essence, this simply “accentuates\\nthe positive” since it increases the pressure\\ndifferential between the upper and lower surface of\\nthe airfoil, and therefore increases total lift over that\\nwhich would have resulted had there been no\\nincrease of pressure at the lower surface. Both\\nBernoulli’s principle and Newton’s laws are in\\noperation whenever lift is being generated by\\nan airfoil.\\nFluid flow or airflow then, is the basis for flight in\\nairplanes, and is a product of the velocity of the\\nairplane. The velocity of the airplane is very\\nimportant to the pilot since it affects the lift and drag\\nforces of the airplane. The pilot uses the velocity\\n(airspeed) to fly at a minimum glide angle, at\\nmaximum endurance, and for a number of other\\nflight maneuvers. Airspeed is the velocity of the\\nairplane relative to the air mass through which it\\nis flying.\\nPRESSURE DISTRIBUTION\\nFrom experiments conducted on wind tunnel models\\nand on full size airplanes, it has been determined that\\nas air flows along the surface of a wing at different\\nangles of attack, there are regions along the surface\\nwhere the pressure is negative, or less than\\natmospheric, and regions where the pressure is\\npositive, or greater than atmospheric. This negative\\npressure on the upper surface creates a relatively\\nlarger force on the wing than is caused by the\\npositive pressure resulting from the air striking the\\nlower wing surface.

In\\nthe design of wing structures, this center of pressure\\ntravel is very important, since it affects the position\\nof the airloads imposed on the wing structure in low\\nangle-of-attack conditions and high angle-of-attack\\nconditions. The airplane’s aerodynamic balance and\\ncontrollability are governed by changes in the center\\nof pressure.\\nThe center of pressure is determined through\\ncalculation and wind tunnel tests by varying the\\nairfoil’s angle of attack through normal operating\\nextremes. As the angle of attack is changed, so are\\nthe various pressure distribution characteristics.\\n[Figure 2-8] Positive (+) and negative (–) pressure\\nforces are totaled for each angle of attack and the\\nresultant force is obtained. The total resultant\\npressure is represented by the resultant force vector\\nshown in figure 2-9. \\nThe point of application of this force vector is\\ntermed the “center of pressure” (CP). For any given\\nangle of attack, the center of pressure is the point\\nwhere the resultant force crosses the chord line. This\\npoint is expressed as a percentage of the chord of the\\nairfoil. A center of pressure at 30 percent of a 60-\\ninch chord would be 18 inches aft of the wing’s\\nleading edge. It would appear then that if the\\ndesigner would place the wing so that its center of\\npressure was at the airplane’s center of gravity, the\\nairplane would always balance. The difficulty arises,\\nhowever, that the location of the center of pressure\\nchanges with change in the airfoil’s angle of attack.\\n[Figure 2-10]\\nIn the airplane’s normal range of flight attitudes, if\\nthe angle of attack is increased, the center of\\npressure moves forward; and if decreased, it moves\\nrearward. Since the center of gravity is fixed at one\\npoint, it is evident that as the angle of attack\\nincreases, the center of lift (CL) moves ahead of the\\ncenter of gravity, creating a force which tends to\\nraise the nose of the airplane or tends to increase the\\nangle of attack still more. On the other hand, if the\\nangle of attack is decreased, the center of lift (CL)\\nmoves aft and tends to decrease the angle a greater\\namount.

It is the bal-\\nance between these forces that the pilot must always\\ncontrol. The better the understanding of the forces and\\nmeans of controlling them, the greater will be the\\npilot’s skill at doing so.\\nThe following defines these forces in relation to\\nstraight-and-level, unaccelerated flight.\\nThrust is the forward force produced by the power-\\nplant/propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of\\ndrag. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the\\nlongitudinal axis. However, this is not always the case\\nas will be explained later.\\nDrag is a rearward, retarding force, and is caused by\\ndisruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other\\nprotruding objects. Drag opposes thrust, and acts rear-\\nward parallel to the relative wind.\\nWeight is the combined load of the airplane itself, the\\ncrew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls\\nthe airplane downward because of the force of gravity.\\nIt opposes lift, and acts vertically downward through\\nthe airplane’s center of gravity.\\nLift opposes the downward force of weight, is pro-\\nduced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the\\nwing, and acts perpendicular to the flightpath through\\nthe wing’s center of lift.\\nIn steady flight, the sum of these opposing forces is\\nequal to zero. There can be no unbalanced forces in\\nsteady, straight flight (Newton’s Third Law). This is\\ntrue whether flying level or when \\nclimbing or\\ndescending. This is not the same thing as saying that\\nthe four forces are all equal. It simply means that\\nthe opposing forces are equal to, and thereby cancel\\nthe effects of, each other. Often the relationship\\nbetween the four forces has been erroneously\\nexplained or illustrated in such a way that this point\\nis obscured. Consider figure 3-1 on the next page,\\nfor example. In the upper illustration the force vectors\\nof thrust, drag, lift, and weight appear to be equal in\\nvalue. The usual explanation states (without stipulat-\\ning that thrust and drag do not equal weight and lift)\\nthat thrust equals drag and lift equals weight as shown\\nin the lower illustration. This basically true statement\\nmust be understood or it can be misleading. It should\\nbe understood that in straight, level, unaccelerated\\nflight, it is true that the opposing lift/weight forces\\nare equal, but they are also greater than the oppos-\\ning forces of thrust/drag that are equal only to each\\nother; not to lift/weight. To be correct about it, it\\nmust be said that in steady flight:\\n• The sum of all upward forces (not just lift) equals\\nthe sum of all downward forces (not just weight).\\n• The sum of all forward forces (not just thrust)\\nequals the sum of all backward forces (not just\\ndrag).\\nThis refinement of the old “thrust equals drag; lift\\nequals weight” formula takes into account the fact that\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-1'),\n",

In glides, a\\nportion of the weight vector is directed forward, and\\ntherefore acts as thrust. In other words, any time the\\nflightpath of the airplane is not horizontal, lift, weight,\\nthrust, and drag vectors must each be broken down into\\ntwo components. [Figure 3-2]\\nFigure 3-2. Force vectors during a stabilized climb.\\nDiscussions of the preceding concepts are frequently\\nomitted in aeronautical texts/handbooks/manuals. The\\nreason is not that they are of no consequence, but\\nbecause by omitting such discussions, the main ideas\\nwith respect to the aerodynamic forces acting upon\\nan airplane in flight can be presented in their most\\nessential elements without being involved in the\\ntechnicalities of the aerodynamicist. In point of fact,\\nconsidering only level flight, and normal climbs and\\nglides in a steady state, it is still true that wing lift is\\nthe really important upward force, and weight is the\\nreally important downward force.\\nFrequently, much of the difficulty encountered in\\nexplaining the forces that act upon an airplane is largely\\na matter of language and its meaning. For example,\\npilots have long believed that an airplane climbs\\nbecause of excess lift. This is not true if one is thinking\\nin terms of wing lift alone. It is true, however, if by lift\\nit is meant the sum total of all “upward forces.” But\\nwhen referring to the “lift of thrust” or the “thrust of\\nweight,” the definitions previously established for\\nthese forces are no longer valid and complicate mat-\\nters. It is this impreciseness in language that affords the\\nexcuse to engage in arguments, largely academic, over\\nrefinements to basic principles.\\nThough\\nthe forces acting on an airplane have already\\nbeen defined, a discussion in more detail to establish\\nhow the pilot uses them to produce controlled flight\\nis appropriate.\\nTHRUST\\nBefore the airplane begins to move, thrust must be\\nexerted. It continues to move and gain speed until\\nthrust and drag are equal. In order to maintain a con-\\nstant airspeed, thrust and drag must remain equal,\\njust as lift and weight must be equal to maintain a\\nconstant altitude. If in level flight, the engine power\\nis reduced, the thrust is lessened, and the airplane\\nslows down. As long as the thrust is less than the\\ndrag, the airplane continues to decelerate until its\\nairspeed is insufficient to support it in the air.\\nLikewise, if the engine power is increased, thrust\\nbecomes greater than drag and the airspeed\\nincreases. As long as the thrust continues to be\\ngreater than the drag, the airplane continues to accel-\\nerate. When drag equals thrust, the airplane flies at a\\nconstant airspeed.\\nStraight-and-level flight may be sustained at speeds\\nfrom very slow to very fast. The pilot must coordi-\\nnate angle of attack and thrust in all speed regimes if\\nthe airplane is to be held in level flight. Roughly,\\nthese regimes can be grouped in three categories:\\nlow-speed flight, cruising flight, and high-speed\\nflight.\\nWhen the airspeed is low, the angle of attack must be\\nrelatively high to increase lift if the balance between\\nlift and weight is to be maintained.

To maintain level flight, the pilot can\\nincrease the angle of attack an amount which will\\ngenerate a lift force again equal to the weight of the\\nairplane and while the airplane will be flying more\\nslowly, it will still maintain level flight if the pilot\\nhas properly coordinated thrust and angle of attack.\\nStraight-and-level flight in the slow speed regime\\nprovides some interesting conditions relative to the\\nequilibrium of forces, because with the airplane in a\\nnose-high attitude, there is a vertical component of\\nthrust that helps support the airplane. For one thing,\\nwing loading tends to be less than would be\\nexpected. Most pilots are aware that an airplane will\\nstall, other conditions being equal, at a slower speed\\nwith the power on than with the power off. (Induced\\nairflow over the wings from the propeller also con-\\ntributes to this.) However, if analysis is restricted to\\nthe four forces as they are usually defined, one can\\nsay that in straight-and-level slow speed flight the\\nthrust is equal to drag, and lift is equal to weight.\\nDuring straight-and level-flight when thrust is\\nincreased and the airspeed increases, the angle of\\nattack must be decreased. That is, if changes have\\nbeen coordinated, the airplane will still remain in\\nlevel flight but at a higher speed when the proper\\nrelationship between thrust and angle of attack is\\nestablished.\\nIf the angle of attack were not coordinated\\n(decreased) with this increase of thrust, the airplane\\nwould climb. But decreasing the angle of attack\\nmodifies the lift, keeping it equal to the weight, and\\nif properly done, the airplane still remains in level\\nflight. Level flight at even slightly negative angles of\\nattack is possible at very high speed. It is evident\\nthen, that level flight can be performed with any\\nangle of attack between stalling angle and the rela-\\ntively small negative angles found at high speed.\\nDRAG\\nDrag in flight is of two basic types: parasite drag\\nand induced drag. The first is called parasite\\nbecause it in no way functions to aid flight, while\\nthe second is induced or created as a result of the\\nwing developing lift.\\nParasite drag is composed of two basic elements:\\nform drag, resulting from the disruption of the\\nstreamline flow; and the resistance of skin friction.\\nOf the two components of parasite drag, form drag is\\nthe easier to reduce when designing an airplane. In\\ngeneral, a more streamlined object produces the best\\nform to reduce parasite drag.\\nSkin friction is the type of parasite drag that is most\\ndifficult to reduce. No surface is perfectly smooth.\\nEven machined surfaces, when inspected through\\nmagnification, have a ragged, uneven appearance.\\nThis rough surface will deflect the streamlines of air\\non the surface, causing resistance to smooth airflow.\\nSkin friction can be minimized by employing a glossy,\\nflat finish to surfaces, and by eliminating protruding\\nrivet heads, roughness, and other irregularities.\\nAnother element must be added to the considera-\\ntion of parasite drag when designing an airplane.\\nThis drag combines the effects of form drag and\\nskin friction and is called interference drag. If two\\nobjects are placed adjacent to one another, the\\nresulting turbulence produced may be 50 to 200\\npercent greater than the parts tested separately.\\nThe three elements, form drag, skin friction, and\\ninterference drag, are all computed to determine\\nparasite drag on an airplane.\\nShape of an object is a big factor in parasite drag.\\nHowever, indicated airspeed is an equally important\\nfactor when speaking of parasite drag. The profile\\ndrag of a streamlined object held in a fixed position\\nrelative to the airflow increases approximately as the\\nsquare of the velocity; thus, doubling the airspeed\\nincreases the drag four times, and tripling the airspeed\\nincreases the drag nine times. This relationship, how-\\never, holds good only at comparatively low subsonic\\nspeeds. At some higher airspeeds, the rate at which\\nprofile drag has been increased with speed suddenly\\nbegins to increase more rapidly.\\nThe second basic type of drag is induced drag. It is\\nan established physical fact that no system, which\\ndoes work in the mechanical sense, can be 100 per-\\ncent efficient.

The more efficient the system,\\nthe smaller this loss.\\nIn level flight the aerodynamic properties of the wing\\nproduce a required lift, but this can be obtained only\\nat the expense of a certain penalty. The name given to\\nthis penalty is induced drag. Induced drag is inherent\\nwhenever a wing is producing lift and, in fact, this\\ntype of drag is inseparable from the production of lift.\\nConsequently, it is always present if lift is produced.\\nThe wing produces the lift force by making use of\\nthe energy of the free airstream. Whenever the wing\\nis producing lift, the pressure on the lower surface of\\nthe wing is greater than that on the upper surface. As\\na result, the air tends to flow from the high pressure\\narea below the wingtip upward to the low pressure\\narea above the wing. In the vicinity of the wingtips,\\nthere is a tendency for these pressures to equalize,\\nresulting in a lateral flow outward from the under-\\nside to the upper surface of the wing. This lateral\\nflow imparts a rotational velocity to the air at the\\nwingtips and trails behind the wing. Therefore, flow\\nabout the wingtips will be in the form of two vortices\\ntrailing behind as the wings move on.\\nWhen the airplane is viewed from the tail, these\\nvortices will circulate counterclockwise about the\\nright wingtip and clockwise about the left wingtip.\\n[Figure 3-4] Bearing in mind the direction of rota-\\ntion of these vortices, it can be seen that they induce\\nan upward flow of air beyond the wingtip, and a\\ndownwash flow behind the wing’s trailing edge. This\\ninduced downwash has nothing in common with the\\ndownwash that is necessary to produce lift. It is, in\\nfact, the source of induced drag. The greater the size\\nand strength of the vortices and consequent down-\\nwash component on the net airflow over the wing,\\nthe greater the induced drag effect becomes. This\\ndownwash over the top of the wing at the tip has the\\nsame effect as bending the lift vector rearward;\\ntherefore, the lift is slightly aft of perpendicular to\\nthe relative wind, creating a rearward lift component.\\nThis is induced drag.\\nIt should be remembered that in order to create a\\ngreater negative pressure on the top of the wing, the\\nwing can be inclined to a higher angle of attack; also,\\nthat if the angle of attack of an asymmetrical wing\\nwere zero, there would be no pressure differential\\nand consequently no downwash component; there-\\nfore, no induced drag. In any case, as angle of attack\\nincreases, induced drag increases proportionally.\\nTo state this another way—the lower the airspeed the\\ngreater the angle of attack required to produce lift\\nequal to the airplane’s weight and consequently, the\\ngreater will be the induced drag. The amount of\\ninduced drag varies inversely as the square of the\\nairspeed.\\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it can be noted that\\nparasite drag increases as the square of the airspeed,\\nand induced drag varies inversely as the square of\\nthe airspeed. It can be seen that as airspeed\\ndecreases to near the stalling speed, the total drag\\nbecomes greater, due mainly to the sharp rise in\\ninduced drag. Similarly, as the airspeed reaches the\\nterminal velocity of the airplane, the total drag\\nagain increases rapidly, due to the sharp increase\\nof parasite drag. As seen in figure 3-5, at some\\ngiven airspeed, total drag is at its maximum\\namount. This is very important in figuring the\\nmaximum endurance and range of airplanes; for\\nwhen drag is at a minimum, power required to\\novercome drag is also at a minimum.\\nTo understand the effect of lift and drag on an air-\\nplane in flight, both must be combined and the\\nlift/drag ratio considered.

When the lift is greater than weight, the air-\\nplane gains altitude.\\nLIFT\\nThe pilot can control the lift. Any time the control\\nwheel is more fore or aft, the angle of attack is\\nchanged. As angle of attack increases, lift increases\\n(all other factors being equal). When the airplane\\nreaches the maximum angle of attack, lift begins to\\ndiminish rapidly. This is the stalling angle of attack,\\nor burble point.\\nBefore proceeding further with lift and how it can be\\ncontrolled, velocity must be interjected. The shape\\nof the wing cannot be effective unless it continually\\nkeeps “attacking” new air. If an airplane is to keep\\nflying, it must keep moving. Lift is proportional to\\nthe square of the airplane’s velocity. For example, an\\nairplane traveling at 200 knots has four times the lift\\nas the same airplane traveling at 100 knots, if the\\nangle of attack and other factors remain constant.\\nActually, the airplane could not continue to travel in\\nlevel flight at a constant altitude and maintain the\\nsame angle of attack if the velocity is increased. The\\nlift would increase and the airplane would climb as\\na result of the increased lift force. Therefore, to\\nmaintain the lift and weight forces in balance, and\\nto keep the airplane “straight and level” (not accel-\\nerating upward) in a state of equilibrium, as velocity\\nis increased, lift must be decreased. This is normally\\naccomplished by reducing the angle of attack; i.e.,\\nlowering the nose. Conversely, as the airplane is\\nslowed, the decreasing velocity requires increasing\\nthe angle of attack to maintain lift sufficient to\\nmaintain flight. There is, of course, a limit to how\\nfar the angle of attack can be increased, if a stall is\\nto be avoided.\\nTherefore, it may be concluded that for every angle\\nof attack there is a corresponding indicated airspeed\\nrequired to maintain altitude in steady, unaccelerated\\nflight—all other factors being constant. (Bear in\\nmind this is only true if maintaining “level flight.”)\\nSince an airfoil will always stall at the same angle\\nof attack, if increasing weight, lift must also be\\nincreased, and the only method for doing so is by\\nincreased velocity if the angle of attack is held\\nconstant just short of the “critical” or stalling angle\\nof attack.\\nLift and drag also vary directly with the density of\\nthe air. Density is affected by several factors: pres-\\nsure, temperature, and humidity. Remember, at an\\naltitude of 18,000 feet, the density of the air has\\none-half the density of air at sea level. Therefore,\\nin order to maintain its lift at a higher altitude, an\\nairplane must fly at a greater true airspeed for any\\ngiven angle of attack.\\nFurthermore, warm air is less dense than cool air,\\nand moist air is less dense than dry air. Thus, on a\\nhot humid day, an airplane must be flown at a greater\\ntrue airspeed for any given angle of attack than on a\\ncool, dry day.\\nIf the density factor is decreased and the total lift\\nmust equal the total weight to remain in flight, it\\nfollows that one of the other factors must be\\nincreased. The factors usually increased are the air-\\nspeed or the angle of attack, because these factors\\ncan be controlled directly by the pilot.\\nIt should also be pointed out that lift varies directly\\nwith the wing area, provided there is no change in\\nthe wing’s planform. If the wings have the same pro-\\nportion and airfoil sections, a wing with a planform\\narea of 200 square feet lifts twice as much at the\\nsame angle of attack as a wing with an area of 100\\nsquare feet.\\nAs can be seen, two major factors from the pilot’s\\nviewpoint are lift and velocity because these are the\\ntwo that can be controlled most readily and accu-\\nrately. Of course, the pilot can also control density\\nby adjusting the altitude and can control wing area\\nif the airplane happens to have flaps of the type that\\nenlarge wing area. However, for most situations, the\\npilot is controlling lift and velocity to maneuver the\\nairplane. For instance, in straight-and-level flight,\\ncruising along at a constant altitude, altitude is\\nmaintained by adjusting lift to match the airplane’s\\nvelocity or cruise airspeed, while maintaining a\\nstate of equilibrium where lift equals weight. In an\\napproach to landing, when the pilot wishes to land\\nas slowly as practical, it is necessary to increase lift\\nto near maximum to maintain lift equal to the weight\\nof the airplane.\\nWINGTIP VORTICES\\nThe action of the airfoil that gives an airplane lift\\nalso causes induced drag. It was determined that\\nwhen a wing is flown at a positive angle of attack, a\\npressure differential exists between the upper and\\nlower surfaces of the wing—that is, the pressure\\nabove the wing is less than atmospheric pressure and\\nthe pressure below the wing is equal to or greater\\nthan atmospheric pressure. Since air always moves\\nfrom high pressure toward low pressure, and the path\\nof least resistance is toward the airplane’s wingtips,\\nthere is a spanwise movement of air from the bottom\\nof the wing outward from the fuselage around the\\nwingtips.

This air current forms a similar vortex at the\\ninboard portion of the trailing edge of the wing,\\nbut because the fuselage limits the inward flow, the\\nvortex is insignificant. Consequently, the deviation\\nin flow direction is greatest at the wingtips where\\nthe unrestricted lateral flow is the strongest. As the\\nair curls upward around the wingtip, it combines\\nwith the wing’s downwash to form a fast spinning\\ntrailing vortex.

This occurs\\nbecause as the angle of attack is increased, there is a\\ngreater pressure difference between the top and bot-\\ntom of the wing, and a greater lateral flow of air;\\nconsequently, this causes more violent vortices to be\\nset up, resulting in more turbulence and more\\ninduced drag.\\nThe intensity or strength of the wingtip vortices is\\ndirectly proportional to the weight of the airplane and\\ninversely proportional to the wingspan and speed of\\nthe airplane. The heavier and slower the airplane, the\\ngreater the angle of attack and the stronger the wingtip\\nvortices. Thus, an airplane will create wingtip vortices\\nwith maximum strength occurring during the takeoff,\\nclimb, and landing phases of flight.\\nGROUND EFFECT\\nIt is possible to fly an airplane just clear of the\\nground (or water) at a slightly slower airspeed\\nthan that required to sustain level flight at higher\\naltitudes. This is the result of a phenomenon,\\nwhich is better known than understood even by\\nsome experienced pilots.\\nWhen an airplane in flight\\ngets within several feet\\nfrom the ground surface, a\\nchange occurs in the three-\\ndimensional flow pattern\\naround the airplane because\\nthe vertical component of\\nthe airflow around the wing\\nis restricted by the ground\\nsurface. This alters the\\nwing’s upwash, downwash,\\nand wingtip vortices.\\n[Figure 3-7] These general\\neffects due to the presence\\nof the ground are referred to as “ground effect.”\\nGround effect, then, is due to the interference of the\\nground (or water) surface with the airflow patterns\\nabout the airplane in flight.\\nWhile the aerodynamic characteristics of the tail sur-\\nfaces and the fuselage are altered by ground effects,\\nthe principal effects due to proximity of the ground\\nare the changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of\\nthe wing. As the wing encounters ground effect and\\nis maintained at a constant lift coefficient, there is\\nconsequent reduction in the upwash, downwash, and\\nthe wingtip vortices.\\nInduced drag is a result of the wing’s work of sus-\\ntaining the airplane and the wing lifts the airplane\\nsimply by accelerating a mass of air downward. It\\nis true that reduced pressure on top of an airfoil is\\nessential to lift, but that is but one of the things\\nthat contributes to the overall effect of pushing an\\nair mass downward. The more downwash there is,\\nthe harder the wing is pushing the mass of air\\ndown. At high angles of attack, the amount of\\ninduced drag is high and since this corresponds to\\nlower airspeeds in actual flight, it can be said that\\ninduced drag predominates at low speed.\\nHowever, the reduction of the wingtip vortices due\\nto ground effect alters the spanwise lift distribution\\nand reduces the induced angle of attack and induced\\ndrag. Therefore, the wing will require a lower angle\\nof attack in ground effect to produce the same lift\\ncoefficient or, if a constant angle of attack is main-\\ntained, an increase in lift coefficient will result.\\n[Figure 3-8]\\nFigure 3-7.

Since induced drag predominates at low\\nspeeds, the reduction of induced drag due to ground\\neffect will cause the most significant reduction of\\nthrust required (parasite plus induced drag) at low\\nspeeds.\\nThe reduction in induced flow due to ground effect\\ncauses a significant reduction in induced drag but\\ncauses no direct effect on parasite drag. As a result\\nof the reduction in induced drag, the thrust required\\nat low speeds will be reduced.\\nDue to the change in upwash, downwash, and\\nwingtip vortices, there may be a change in position\\n(installation) error of the airspeed system, associated\\nwith ground effect. In the majority of cases, ground\\neffect will cause an increase in the local pressure at\\nthe static source and produce a lower indication of\\nairspeed and altitude. Thus, the airplane may be air-\\nborne at an indicated airspeed less than that normally\\nrequired.\\nIn order for ground effect to be of significant magni-\\ntude, the wing must be quite close to the ground. One\\nof the direct results of ground effect is the variation\\nof induced drag with wing height above the ground at\\na constant lift coefficient. When the wing is at a\\nheight equal to its span, the reduction in induced drag\\nis only 1.4 percent. However, when the wing is at a\\nheight equal to one-fourth its span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is 23.5 percent and, when the wing is at\\na height equal to one-tenth its span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is 47.6 percent. Thus, a large reduction\\nin induced drag will take place only when the wing is\\nvery close to the ground. Because of this variation,\\nground effect is most usually recognized during the\\nliftoff for takeoff or just prior to touchdown when\\nlanding.\\nDuring the takeoff phase of flight, ground effect pro-\\nduces some important relationships. The airplane\\nleaving ground effect after takeoff encounters just\\nthe reverse of the airplane entering ground effect\\nduring landing; i.e., the airplane leaving ground\\neffect will:\\n• Require an increase in angle of attack to maintain\\nthe same lift coefficient.\\n• Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust\\nrequired.\\n• Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up\\nchange in moment.\\n• Produce a reduction in static source pressure and\\nincrease in indicated airspeed.\\nThese general effects should point out the possible\\ndanger in attempting takeoff prior to achieving the\\nrecommended takeoff speed. Due to the reduced drag\\nin ground effect, the airplane may seem capable of\\ntakeoff well below the recommended speed.\\nHowever, as the airplane rises out of ground effect\\nwith a deficiency of speed, the greater induced drag\\nmay result in very marginal initial climb perform-\\nance. In the extreme conditions such as high gross\\nweight, high density altitude, and high temperature, a\\ndeficiency of airspeed during takeoff may permit the\\nairplane to become airborne but be incapable of flying\\nout of ground effect. In this case, the airplane may\\nbecome airborne initially with a deficiency of speed,\\nand then settle back to the runway. It is important that\\nno attempt be made to force the airplane to become\\nairborne with a deficiency of speed; the recommended\\ntakeoff speed is necessary to provide adequate initial\\nclimb performance. For this reason, it is imperative\\nthat a definite climb be established before retracting\\nthe landing gear or flaps.\\nDuring the landing phase of flight, the effect of prox-\\nimity to the ground also must be understood and\\nappreciated. If the airplane is brought into ground\\neffect with a constant angle of attack, the airplane\\nwill experience an increase in lift coefficient and a\\nreduction in the thrust required. Hence, a “floating”\\neffect may occur. Because of the reduced drag and\\npower off deceleration in ground effect, any excess\\nspeed at the point of flare may incur a considerable\\n“float” distance. As the airplane nears the point of\\ntouchdown, ground effect will be most realized at\\naltitudes less than the wingspan. During the final\\nphases of the approach as the airplane nears the\\nground, a reduced power setting is necessary or the\\nreduced thrust required would allow the airplane to\\nclimb above the desired glidepath.\\nAXES OF AN AIRPLANE\\nWhenever an airplane changes its flight attitude or\\nposition in flight, it rotates about one or more of\\nthree axes, which are imaginary lines that pass\\nthrough the airplane’s center of gravity. The axes of\\nan airplane can be considered as imaginary axles\\naround which the airplane turns, much like the axle\\naround which a wheel rotates. At the point where all\\nthree axes intersect, each is at a 90° angle to the other\\ntwo. The axis, which extends lengthwise through the\\nfuselage from the nose to the tail, is the longitudinal\\naxis. The axis, which extends crosswise from\\nwingtip to wingtip, is the lateral axis. The axis,\\nwhich passes vertically through the center of gravity,\\nis the vertical axis. [Figure 3-9]\\nThe airplane’s motion about its longitudinal axis\\nresembles the roll of a ship from side to side. In fact,\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-8'),\n",

Roll is\\ncontrolled by the ailerons; pitch is controlled by the\\nelevators; yaw is controlled by the rudder. The use of\\nthese controls is explained in Chapter 4—Flight\\nControls.\\nMOMENTS AND MOMENT ARM\\nA study of physics shows that a body that is free to\\nrotate will always turn about its center of gravity. In\\naerodynamic terms, the mathematical measure of an\\nairplane’s tendency to rotate about its center of\\ngravity is called a “moment.” A moment is said to be\\nequal to the product of the force applied and the dis-\\ntance at which the force is applied. (A moment arm is\\nthe distance from a datum [reference point or line] to\\nthe applied force.) For airplane weight and balance\\ncomputations, “moments” are expressed in terms of\\nthe distance of the arm times the airplane’s weight, or\\nsimply, inch pounds.\\nAirplane designers locate the fore and aft position of\\nthe airplane’s center of gravity as nearly as possible\\nto the 20 percent point of the mean aerodynamic\\nchord (MAC). If the thrust line is designed to pass\\nhorizontally through the center of gravity, it will not\\ncause the airplane to pitch when power is changed,\\nand there will be no difference in moment due to\\nthrust for a power-on or power-off condition of\\nflight. Although designers have some control over\\nthe location of the drag forces, they are not always\\nable to make the resultant drag forces pass through\\nthe center of gravity of the airplane. However, the\\none item over which they have the greatest control\\nis the size and location of the tail. The objective is\\nto make the moments (due to thrust, drag, and lift)\\nas small as possible; and, by proper location of the\\ntail, to provide the means of balancing the airplane\\nlongitudinally for any condition of flight.\\nThe pilot has no direct control over the location of\\nforces acting on the airplane in flight, except for\\ncontrolling the center of lift by changing the angle\\nof attack. Such a change, however, immediately\\ninvolves changes in other forces. Therefore, the\\npilot cannot independently change the location of\\none force without changing the effect of others. For\\nexample, a change in airspeed involves a change in\\nlift, as well as a change in drag and a change in the\\nup or down force on the tail. As forces such as tur-\\nbulence and gusts act to displace the airplane, the\\npilot reacts by providing opposing control forces to\\ncounteract this displacement.\\nSome airplanes are subject to changes in the location\\nof the center of gravity with variations of load.\\nTrimming devices are used to counteract the forces\\nset up by fuel burnoff, and loading or off-loading of\\npassengers or cargo. Elevator trim tabs and\\nadjustable horizontal stabilizers comprise the most\\ncommon devices provided to the pilot for trimming\\nfor load variations. Over the wide ranges of balance\\nduring flight in large airplanes, the force which the\\npilot has to exert on the controls would become\\nexcessive and fatiguing if means of trimming were\\nnot provided.\\nDESIGN CHARACTERISTICS\\nEvery pilot who has flown numerous types of air-\\nplanes has noted that each airplane handles somewhat\\ndifferently—that is, each resists or responds to\\ncontrol pressures in its own way.

These features can be designed into an air-\\nplane to facilitate the particular purpose the airplane\\nis to fulfill by considering certain stability and\\nmaneuvering requirements. In the following discus-\\nsion, it is intended to summarize the more important\\naspects of an airplane’s stability; its maneuvering\\nand controllability qualities; how they are analyzed;\\nand their relationship to various flight conditions. In\\nbrief, the basic differences between stability, maneu-\\nverability, and controllability are as follows:\\n• Stability —The inherent quality of an airplane\\nto correct for conditions that may disturb its\\nequilibrium, and to return or to continue on the\\noriginal flightpath. It is primarily an airplane\\ndesign characteristic.\\n• Maneuverability —The quality of an airplane\\nthat permits it to be maneuvered easily and to\\nwithstand the stresses imposed by maneuvers. It\\nis governed by the airplane’s weight, inertia, size\\nand location of flight controls, structural\\nstrength, and powerplant. It too is an airplane\\ndesign characteristic.\\n• Controllability —The capability of an airplane to\\nrespond to the pilot’s control, especially with\\nregard to flightpath and attitude. It is the quality\\nof the airplane’s response to the pilot’s control\\napplication when maneuvering the airplane,\\nregardless of its stability characteristics.\\nBASIC CONCEPTS OF STABILITY\\nThe flightpaths and attitudes in which an airplane\\ncan fly are limited only by the aerodynamic charac-\\nteristics of the airplane, its propulsive system, and its\\nstructural strength. These limitations indicate the\\nmaximum performance and maneuverability of the\\nairplane. If the airplane is to provide maximum util-\\nity, it must be safely controllable to the full extent of\\nthese limits without exceeding the pilot’s strength\\nor requiring exceptional flying ability. If an airplane\\nis to fly straight and steady along any arbitrary\\nflightpath, the forces acting on it must be in static\\nequilibrium. The reaction of any body when its\\nequilibrium is disturbed is referred to as stability.\\nThere are two types of stability; static and dynamic.\\nStatic will be discussed first, and in this discussion\\nthe following definitions will apply:\\n• Equilibrium —All opposing forces acting on the\\nairplane are balanced; (i.e., steady, unaccelerated\\nflight conditions).\\n• Static Stability —The initial tendency that the air-\\nplane displays after its equilibrium is disturbed.\\n• Positive Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to return to the original state of\\nequilibrium after being disturbed. [Figure 3-10]\\n• Negative Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to continue away from the original\\nstate of equilibrium after being disturbed. [Figure\\n3-10]\\n• Neutral Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to remain in a new condition after\\nits equilibrium has been disturbed.

When designing the airplane,\\nengineers must compromise between stability,\\nmaneuverability, and controllability; and the problem\\nis compounded because of the airplane’s three-axis\\nfreedom. Too much stability is detrimental to\\nmaneuverability, and similarly, not enough stabil-\\nity is detrimental to controllability. In the design\\nof airplanes, compromise between the two is the\\nkeyword.\\nDYNAMIC STABILITY\\nStatic stability has been defined as the initial tendency\\nthat the airplane displays after being disturbed from its\\ntrimmed condition. Occasionally, the initial tendency\\nis different or opposite from the overall tendency, so\\ndistinction must be made between the two. Dynamic\\nstability is the overall tendency that the airplane dis-\\nplays after its equilibrium is disturbed. The curves of\\nfigure 3-11 represent the variation of controlled\\nfunctions versus time. It is seen that the unit of time\\nis very significant. If the time unit for one cycle or\\noscillation is above 10 seconds’ duration, it is called\\na “long-period” oscillation (phugoid) and is easily\\ncontrolled. In a longitudinal phugoid oscillation,\\nthe angle of attack remains constant when the air-\\nspeed increases and decreases. To a certain degree,\\na convergent phugoid is desirable but is not\\nrequired. The phugoid can be determined only on a\\nstatically stable airplane, and this has a great effect\\non the trimming qualities of the airplane. If the\\ntime unit for one cycle or oscillation is less than\\none or two seconds, it is called a “short-period”\\noscillation and is normally very difficult, if not\\nimpossible, for the pilot to control. This is the type\\nof oscillation that the pilot can easily “get in phase\\nwith” and reinforce.\\nA neutral or divergent, short-period oscillation is\\ndangerous because structural failure usually\\nresults if the oscillation is not damped immedi-\\nately. Short-period oscillations affect airplane and\\ncontrol surfaces alike and reveal themselves as\\n“porpoising” in the airplane, or as in “buzz” or\\n“flutter” in the control surfaces. Basically, the\\nshort-period oscillation is a change in angle of\\nattack with no change in airspeed. A short-period\\noscillation of a control surface is usually of such\\nhigh frequency that the airplane does not have\\ntime to react. Logically, the Code of Federal\\nRegulations require that short-period oscillations\\nbe heavily damped (i.e., die out immediately).\\nFlight tests during the airworthiness certification\\nof airplanes are conducted for this condition by\\ninducing the oscillation in the controls for pitch,\\nroll, or yaw at the most critical speed (i.e., at V\\nNE,\\nthe never-exceed speed). The test pilot strikes the\\ncontrol wheel or rudder pedal a sharp blow and\\nobserves the results.\\nLONGITUDINAL STABILITY (PITCHING)\\nIn designing an airplane, a great deal of effort is\\nspent in developing the desired degree of stability\\naround all three axes.

It involves the\\npitching motion as the airplane’s nose moves up and\\ndown in flight. A longitudinally unstable airplane has\\na tendency to dive or climb progressively into a very\\nsteep dive or climb, or even a stall. Thus, an airplane\\nwith longitudinal instability becomes difficult and\\nsometimes dangerous to fly.\\nStatic longitudinal stability or instability in an air-\\nplane, is dependent upon three factors:\\n1. Location of the wing with respect to the center of\\ngravity;\\n2. Location of the horizontal tail surfaces with\\nrespect to the center of gravity; and\\n3. The area or size of the tail surfaces.\\nIn analyzing stability, it should be recalled that a\\nbody that is free to rotate will always turn about its\\ncenter of gravity.\\nTo obtain static longitudinal stability, the relation of\\nthe wing and tail moments must be such that, if the\\nmoments are initially balanced and the airplane is\\nsuddenly nosed up, the wing moments and tail\\nmoments will change so that the sum of their forces\\nwill provide an unbalanced but restoring moment\\nwhich, in turn, will bring the nose down again.\\nSimilarly, if the airplane is nosed down, the resulting\\nchange in moments will bring the nose back up.\\nThe center of lift, sometimes called the center of\\npressure, in most unsymmetrical airfoils has a ten-\\ndency to change its fore and aft position with a\\nchange in the angle of attack. The center of pressure\\ntends to move forward with an increase in angle of\\nattack and to move aft with a decrease in angle of\\nattack. This means that when the angle of attack of\\nan airfoil is increased, the center of pressure (lift) by\\nmoving forward, tends to lift the leading edge of the\\nwing still more. This tendency gives the wing an\\ninherent quality of instability.\\nFigure 3-12 shows an airplane in straight-and-level\\nflight. The line CG-CL-T represents the airplane’s\\nlongitudinal axis from the center of gravity (CG) to\\na point T on the horizontal stabilizer. The center of\\nlift (or center of pressure) is represented by the\\npoint CL.\\nMost airplanes are designed so that the wing’s center\\nof lift (CL) is to the rear of the center of gravity. This\\nmakes the airplane “nose heavy” and requires that\\nthere be a slight downward force on the horizontal\\nstabilizer in order to balance the airplane and keep\\nthe nose from continually pitching downward.\\nCompensation for this nose heaviness is provided\\nby setting the horizontal stabilizer at a slight neg-\\native angle of attack. The downward force thus\\nproduced, holds the tail down, counterbalancing\\nthe “heavy” nose. It is as if the line CG-CL-T was\\na lever with an upward force at CL and two down-\\nward forces balancing each other, one a strong\\nforce at the CG point and the other, a much lesser\\nforce, at point T (downward air pressure on the\\nstabilizer). Applying simple physics principles, it\\ncan be seen that if an iron bar were suspended at\\npoint CL with a heavy weight hanging on it at the\\nCG, it would take some downward pressure at\\npoint T to keep the “lever” in balance.\\nEven though the horizontal stabilizer may be level\\nwhen the airplane is in level flight, there is a\\ndownwash of air from the wings. This downwash\\nstrikes the top of the stabilizer and produces a\\ndownward pressure, which at a certain speed will\\nbe just enough to balance the “lever.” The faster\\nthe airplane is flying, the greater this downwash\\nand the greater the downward force on the horizontal\\nstabilizer (except “T” tails). [Figure 3-13] In air-\\nplanes with fixed position horizontal stabilizers, the\\nairplane manufacturer sets the stabilizer at an angle\\nthat will provide the best stability (or balance)\\nduring flight at the design cruising speed and\\npower setting. [Figure 3-14]\\nIf the airplane’s speed decreases, the speed of the air-\\nflow over the wing is decreased. As a result of this\\ndecreased flow of air over the wing, the downwash\\nis reduced, causing a lesser downward force on the\\nhorizontal stabilizer. In turn, the characteristic nose\\nheaviness is accentuated, causing the airplane’s nose\\nto pitch down more. This places the airplane in a\\nnose-low attitude, lessening the wing’s angle of\\nattack and drag and allowing the airspeed to\\nincrease. As the airplane continues in the nose-low\\nattitude and its speed increases, the downward force\\non the horizontal stabilizer is once again increased.\\nCL\\nCG\\nCLCG\\nT\\nT\\nFigure 3-12.

However, because\\nthe airplane is dynamically stable, the nose does not\\nlower as far this time as it did before. The airplane\\nwill acquire enough speed in this more gradual dive\\nto start it into another climb, but the climb is not so\\nsteep as the preceding one.\\nAfter several of these diminishing oscillations, in\\nwhich the nose alternately rises and lowers, the air-\\nplane will finally settle down to a speed at which\\nthe downward force on the tail exactly counteracts\\nthe tendency of the airplane to dive. When this\\ncondition is attained, the airplane will once again\\nbe in balanced flight and will continue in stabi-\\nlized flight as long as this attitude and airspeed are\\nnot changed.\\nA similar effect will be noted upon closing the\\nthrottle. The downwash of the wings is reduced\\nand the force at T in figure 3-12 is not enough to\\nhold the horizontal stabilizer down. It is as if the\\nforce at T on the lever were allowing the force of\\ngravity to pull the nose down. This, of course, is a\\ndesirable characteristic because the airplane is\\ninherently trying to regain airspeed and reestablish\\nthe proper balance.\\nPower or thrust can also have a destabilizing effect\\nin that an increase of power may tend to make the\\nnose rise. The airplane designer can offset this by\\nestablishing a “high thrustline” wherein the line of\\nthrust passes above the center of gravity. [Figures\\n3-15 and 3-16] In this case, as power or thrust is\\nincreased a moment is produced to counteract the\\ndown load on the tail. On the other hand, a very\\n“low thrust line” would tend to add to the nose-up\\neffect of the horizontal tail surface.\\nFigure 3-15. Thrust line affects longitudinal stability.\\nIt can be concluded, then, that with the center of gravity\\nforward of the center of lift, and with an aerodynamic\\ntail-down force, the result is that the airplane always\\ntries to return to a safe flying attitude.\\nA simple demonstration of longitudinal stability may\\nbe made as follows: Trim the airplane for “hands off”\\ncontrol in level flight.

If the oscillations\\ngradually cease, the airplane has positive stability;\\nif they continue unevenly, the airplane has neutral\\nstability; if they increase, the airplane is unstable.\\nLATERAL STABILITY (ROLLING)\\nStability about the airplane’s longitudinal axis,\\nwhich extends from nose to tail, is called lateral\\nstability. This helps to stabilize the lateral or\\nrolling effect when one wing gets lower than the\\nwing on the opposite side of the airplane. There are\\nfour main design factors that make an airplane sta-\\nble laterally: dihedral, keel effect, sweepback, and\\nweight distribution.\\nThe most common procedure for producing lateral\\nstability is to build the wings with a dihedral angle\\nvarying from one to three degrees. In other words, the\\nwings on either side of the airplane join the fuselage\\nto form a slight V or angle called “dihedral,” and this\\nis measured by the angle made by each wing above a\\nline parallel to the lateral axis.\\nThe basis of rolling stability is, of course, the lat-\\neral balance of forces produced by the airplane’s\\nwings. Any imbalance in lift results in a tendency\\nfor the airplane to roll about its longitudinal axis.\\nStated another way, dihedral involves a balance of\\nlift created by the wings’ angle of attack on each\\nside of the airplane’s longitudinal axis.\\nIf a momentary gust of wind forces one wing of the\\nairplane to rise and the other to lower, the airplane\\nwill bank. When the airplane is banked without turn-\\ning, it tends to sideslip or slide downward toward the\\nlowered wing. [Figure 3-17] Since the wings have\\ndihedral, the air strikes the low wing at much greater\\nangle of attack than the high wing. This increases the\\nlift on the low wing and decreases lift on the high\\nwing, and tends to restore the airplane to its original\\nlateral attitude (wings level)—that is, the angle of\\nattack and lift on the two wings are again equal.\\nFigure 3-17. Dihedral for lateral stability.\\nThe effect of dihedral, then, is to produce a rolling\\nmoment tending to return the airplane to a laterally\\nbalanced flight condition when a sideslip occurs.\\nThe restoring force may move the low wing up too\\nfar, so that the opposite wing now goes down. If so,\\nthe process will be repeated, decreasing with each\\nlateral oscillation until a balance for wings-level\\nflight is finally reached.\\nConversely, excessive dihedral has an adverse effect\\non lateral maneuvering qualities. The airplane may be\\nso stable laterally that it resists any intentional rolling\\nmotion. For this reason, airplanes that require fast roll\\nor banking characteristics usually have less dihedral\\nthan those designed for less maneuverability.\\nThe contribution of sweepback to dihedral effect is\\nimportant because of the nature of the contribution.\\nIn a sideslip, the wing into the wind is operating with\\nan effective decrease in sweepback, while the wing\\nout of the wind is operating with an effective increase\\nin sweepback. The swept wing is responsive only to\\nthe wind component that is perpendicular to the\\nwing’s leading edge.

In this manner, the\\nswept back wing would contribute a positive dihedral\\neffect and the swept forward wing would contribute a\\nnegative dihedral effect.\\nDuring flight, the side area of the airplane’s fuselage\\nand vertical fin react to the airflow in much the same\\nmanner as the keel of a ship. That is, it exerts a\\nsteadying influence on the airplane laterally about\\nthe longitudinal axis.\\nSuch laterally stable airplanes are constructed so that\\nthe greater portion of the keel area is above and\\nbehind the center of gravity. [Figure 3-18] Thus,\\nwhen the airplane slips to one side, the combination\\nof the airplane’s weight and the pressure of the air-\\nflow against the upper portion of the keel area (both\\nacting about the CG) tends to roll the airplane back\\nto wings-level flight.\\nFigure 3-18. Keel area for lateral stability.\\nVERTICAL STABILITY (YAWING)\\nStability about the airplane’s vertical axis (the side-\\nways moment) is called yawing or directional stability.\\nYawing or directional stability is the more easily\\nachieved stability in airplane design. The area of the\\nvertical fin and the sides of the fuselage aft of the\\ncenter of gravity are the prime contributors which\\nmake the airplane act like the well known weather-\\nvane or arrow, pointing its nose into the relative\\nwind.\\nIn examining a weathervane, it can be seen that if\\nexactly the same amount of surface were exposed\\nto the wind in front of the pivot point as behind it,\\nthe forces fore and aft would be in balance and\\nlittle or no directional movement would result.\\nConsequently, it is necessary to have a greater\\nsurface aft of the pivot point that forward of it.\\nSimilarly in an airplane, the designer must ensure\\npositive directional stability by making the side\\nsurface greater aft than ahead of the center of\\ngravity. [Figure 3-19] To provide more positive\\nstability aside from that provided by the fuselage,\\na vertical fin is added. The fin acts similar to the\\nfeather on an arrow in maintaining straight flight.\\nLike the weathervane and the arrow, the farther aft\\nthis fin is placed and the larger its size, the greater\\nthe airplane’s directional stability.\\nFigure 3-19. Fuselage and fin for vertical stability.\\nIf an airplane is flying in a straight line, and a side-\\nward gust of air gives the airplane a slight rotation\\nabout its vertical axis (i.e., the right), the motion is\\nretarded and stopped by the fin because while the\\nairplane is rotating to the right, the air is striking the\\nleft side of the fin at an angle. This causes pressure\\non the left side of the fin, which resists the turning\\nmotion and slows down the airplane’s yaw. In doing\\nso, it acts somewhat like the weathervane by turning\\nthe airplane into the relative wind. The initial change\\nin direction of the airplane’s flightpath is generally\\nslightly behind its change of heading. Therefore,\\nafter a slight yawing of the airplane to the right, there\\nis a brief moment when the airplane is still moving\\nalong its original path, but its longitudinal axis is\\npointed slightly to the right.\\nThe airplane is then momentarily skidding sideways,\\nand during that moment (since it is assumed that\\nalthough the yawing motion has stopped, the excess\\npressure on the left side of the fin still persists) there\\nCG\\nCG\\nCenterline\\nCenterline\\nCG\\nArea\\nForward\\nof CG\\nArea AFT\\nof CG\\nCG\\nRelative Wind Yaw\\nYaw\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-15'),\n",

That is, there is a momen-\\ntary restoring tendency caused by the fin.\\nThis restoring tendency is relatively slow in develop-\\ning and ceases when the airplane stops skidding. When\\nit ceases, the airplane will be flying in a direction\\nslightly different from the original direction. In\\nother words, it will not of its own accord return to\\nthe original heading; the pilot must reestablish the\\ninitial heading.\\nA minor improvement of directional stability may\\nbe obtained through sweepback. Sweepback is incor-\\nporated in the design of the wing primarily to delay\\nthe onset of compressibility during high-speed flight.\\nIn lighter and slower airplanes, sweepback aids\\nin locating the center of pressure in the correct\\nrelationship with the center of gravity. A longitudinally\\nstable airplane is built with the center of pressure aft of\\nthe center of gravity.\\nBecause of structural reasons, airplane designers\\nsometimes cannot attach the wings to the fuselage at\\nthe exact desired point. If they had to mount the\\nwings too far forward, and at right angles to the\\nfuselage, the center of pressure would not be far\\nenough to the rear to result in the desired amount of\\nlongitudinal stability. By building sweepback into\\nthe wings, however, the designers can move the cen-\\nter of pressure toward the rear. The amount of\\nsweepback and the position of the wings then place\\nthe center of pressure in the correct location.\\nThe contribution of the wing to static directional sta-\\nbility is usually small. The swept wing provides a\\nstable contribution depending on the amount of\\nsweepback, but the contribution is relatively small\\nwhen compared with other components.\\nFREE DIRECTIONAL \\nOSCILLATIONS (DUTCH ROLL)\\nDutch Roll is a coupled lateral/directional oscillation\\nthat is usually dynamically stable but is objectionable\\nin an airplane because of the oscillatory nature. The\\ndamping of the oscillatory mode may be weak or\\nstrong depending on the properties of the particular\\nairplane.\\nUnfortunately all air is not smooth. There are bumps\\nand depressions created by gusty updrafts and down-\\ndrafts, and by gusts from ahead, behind, or the side\\nof the airplane.\\nThe response of the airplane to a disturbance from\\nequilibrium is a combined rolling/yawing oscillation\\nin which the rolling motion is phased to precede\\nthe yawing motion. The yawing motion is not too\\nsignificant, but the roll is much more noticeable.\\nWhen the airplane rolls back toward level flight in\\nresponse to dihedral effect, it rolls back too far\\nand sideslips the other way. Thus, the airplane\\novershoots each time because of the strong dihe-\\ndral effect. When the dihedral effect is large in\\ncomparison with static directional stability, the\\nDutch Roll motion has weak damping and is\\nobjectionable. When the static directional stability\\nis strong in comparison with the dihedral effect,\\nthe Dutch Roll motion has such heavy damping\\nthat it is not objectionable. However, these qualities\\ntend toward spiral instability.\\nThe choice is then the least of two evils—Dutch Roll\\nis objectionable and spiral instability is tolerable if\\nthe rate of divergence is low. Since the more\\nimportant handling qualities are a result of high\\nstatic directional stability and minimum necessary\\ndihedral effect, most airplanes demonstrate a mild\\nspiral tendency. This tendency would be indicated\\nto the pilot by the fact that the airplane cannot be\\nflown “hands off” indefinitely.\\nIn most modern airplanes, except high-speed\\nswept wing designs, these free directional oscilla-\\ntions usually die out automatically in a very few\\ncycles unless the air continues to be gusty or\\nturbulent. Those airplanes with continuing Dutch\\nRoll tendencies usually are equipped with gyro\\nstabilized yaw dampers. An airplane that has\\nDutch Roll tendencies is disconcerting, to say the\\nleast. Therefore, the manufacturer tries to reach a\\nmedium between too much and too little direc-\\ntional stability. Because it is more desirable for\\nthe airplane to have “spiral instability” than Dutch\\nRoll tendencies, most airplanes are designed with\\nthat characteristic.\\nSPIRAL INSTABILITY\\nSpiral instability exists when the static directional\\nstability of the airplane is very strong as compared\\nto the effect of its dihedral in maintaining lateral\\nequilibrium. When the lateral equilibrium of the\\nairplane is disturbed by a gust of air and a sideslip\\nis introduced, the strong directional stability tends\\nto yaw the nose into the resultant relative wind\\nwhile the comparatively weak dihedral lags in\\nrestoring the lateral balance. Due to this yaw, the\\nwing on the outside of the turning moment travels\\nforward faster than the inside wing and as a conse-\\nquence, its lift becomes greater. This produces an\\noverbanking tendency which, if not corrected by\\nthe pilot, will result in the bank angle becoming\\nsteeper and steeper. At the same time, the strong\\ndirectional stability that yaws the airplane into the\\nrelative wind is actually forcing the nose to a lower\\npitch attitude.

This tendency would\\nbe indicated to the pilot by the fact that the airplane\\ncannot be flown “hands off” indefinitely.\\nMuch study and effort has gone into development\\nof control devices (wing leveler) to eliminate or at\\nleast correct this instability. Advanced stages of\\nthis spiral condition demand that the pilot be very\\ncareful in application of recovery controls, or\\nexcessive loads on the structure may be imposed.\\nOf the in-flight structural failures that have\\noccurred in general aviation airplanes, improper\\nrecovery from this condition has probably been\\nthe underlying cause of more fatalities than any\\nother single factor. The reason is that the airspeed\\nin the spiral condition builds up rapidly, and the\\napplication of back elevator force to reduce this\\nspeed and to pull the nose up only “tightens the\\nturn,” increasing the load factor. The results of the\\nprolonged uncontrolled spiral are always the\\nsame; either in-flight structural failure, crashing\\ninto the ground, or both. The most common causes\\non record for getting into this situation are: loss of\\nhorizon reference, inability of the pilot to control\\nthe airplane by reference to instruments, or a com-\\nbination of both. \\nAERODYNAMIC FORCES \\nIN FLIGHT MANEUVERS\\nFORCES IN\\nTURNS\\nIf an airplane\\nwere viewed in\\ns t r a i g h t - a n d -\\nlevel flight from\\nthe rear [figure\\n3-20], and if the\\nforces acting on\\nthe airplane actu-\\nally could be\\nseen, two forces\\n(lift and weight)\\nwould be apparent, and if the airplane were in a bank it\\nwould be apparent that lift did not act directly opposite\\nto the weight—it now acts in the direction of the bank.\\nThe fact that when the airplane banks, lift acts inward\\ntoward the center of the turn, as well as upward, is one\\nof the basic truths to remember in the consideration of\\nturns.\\nAn object at rest or moving in a straight line will\\nremain at rest or continue to move in a straight line\\nuntil acted on by some other force. An airplane, like\\nany moving object, requires a sideward force to\\nmake it turn. In a normal turn, this force is supplied\\nby banking the airplane so that lift is exerted inward\\nas well as upward. The force of lift during a turn is\\nseparated into two components at right angles to\\neach other. One component, which acts vertically\\nand opposite to the weight (gravity), is called the\\n“vertical component of lift.” The other, which acts\\nhorizontally toward the center of the turn, is called\\nthe “horizontal component of lift,” or centripetal\\nforce. The horizontal component of lift is the force\\nthat pulls the airplane from a straight flightpath to\\nmake it turn. Centrifugal force is the “equal and\\nopposite reaction” of the airplane to the change in\\ndirection and acts equal and opposite to the hori-\\nzontal component of lift. This explains why, in a\\ncorrectly executed turn, the force that turns the\\nairplane is not supplied by the rudder.\\nAn airplane is not steered like a boat or an automo-\\nbile; in order for it to turn, it must be banked. If the\\nairplane is not banked, there is no force available that\\nwill cause it to deviate from a straight flightpath.\\nConversely, when an airplane is banked, it will turn,\\nprovided it is not slipping to the inside of the turn.\\nGood directional control is based on the fact that the\\nairplane will attempt to turn whenever it is banked.\\nCentripetal Force – The force opposite centrifugal force and attracts a\\nbody towards its axis of rotation. \\nCentrifugal Force—An apparent force resulting from the effect of iner-\\ntia during a turn.\\nFigure 3-20.

This division reduces the amount of\\nlift which is opposing gravity and actually support-\\ning the airplane’s weight; consequently, the airplane\\nloses altitude unless additional lift is created. This is\\ndone by increasing the angle of attack until the verti-\\ncal component of lift is again equal to the weight.\\nSince the vertical component of lift decreases as the\\nbank angle increases, the angle of attack must be\\nprogressively increased to produce sufficient verti-\\ncal lift to support the airplane’s weight. The fact that\\nthe vertical component of lift must be equal to the\\nweight to maintain altitude is an important fact to\\nremember when making constant altitude turns.\\nAt a given airspeed, the rate at which an airplane\\nturns depends upon the magnitude of the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift. It will be found that the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift is proportional to the angle of\\nbank—that is, it increases or decreases respectively\\nas the angle of bank increases or decreases. It logi-\\ncally follows then, that as the angle of bank is\\nincreased the horizontal component of lift increases,\\nthereby increasing the rate of turn. Consequently, at\\nany given airspeed the rate of turn can be controlled\\nby adjusting the angle of bank.\\nTo provide a vertical component of lift sufficient to\\nhold altitude in a level turn, an increase in the angle\\nof attack is required. Since the drag of the airfoil is\\ndirectly proportional to its angle of attack, induced\\ndrag will increase as the lift is increased. This, in\\nturn, causes a loss of airspeed in proportion to the\\nangle of bank; a small angle of bank results in a\\nsmall reduction in airspeed and a large angle of\\nbank results in a large reduction in airspeed.\\nAdditional thrust (power) must be applied to pre-\\nvent a reduction in airspeed in level turns; the\\nrequired amount of additional thrust is proportional\\nto the angle of bank.\\nTo compensate for added lift, which would result if\\nthe airspeed were increased during a turn, the angle\\nof attack must be decreased, or the angle of bank\\nincreased, if a constant altitude were to be main-\\ntained. If the angle of bank were held constant and\\nthe angle of attack decreased, the rate of turn would\\ndecrease. Therefore, in order to maintain a constant\\nrate of turn as the airspeed is increased, the angle of\\nattack must remain constant and the angle of bank\\nincreased.\\nIt must be remembered that an increase in airspeed\\nresults in an increase of the turn radius and that cen-\\ntrifugal force is directly proportional to the radius of\\nthe turn. In a correctly executed turn, the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift must be exactly equal and opposite\\nto the centrifugal force. Therefore, as the airspeed is\\nincreased in a constant rate level turn, the radius of\\nthe turn increases. This increase in the radius of turn\\ncauses an increase in the centrifugal force, which\\nmust be balanced by an increase in the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift, which can only be increased by\\nincreasing the angle of bank.\\nIn a slipping turn, the airplane is not turning at the\\nrate appropriate to the bank being used, since the air-\\nplane is yawed toward the outside of the turning\\nflightpath. The airplane is banked too much for the\\nrate of turn, so the horizontal lift component is\\ngreater than the centrifugal force.

The rate of\\nturn is too great for the angle of bank. Correction of\\na skidding turn thus involves a reduction in the rate\\nof turn, an increase in bank, or a combination of the\\ntwo changes.\\nTo maintain a given rate of turn, the angle of bank\\nmust be varied with the airspeed. This becomes par-\\nticularly important in high-speed airplanes. For\\ninstance, at 400 miles per hour (m.p.h.), an airplane\\nmust be banked approximately 44° to execute a\\nstandard rate turn (3° per second). At this angle of\\nbank, only about 79 percent of the lift of the airplane\\ncomprises the vertical component of the lift; the\\nresult is a loss of altitude unless the angle of attack\\nis increased sufficiently to compensate for the loss\\nof vertical lift.\\nFORCES IN CLIMBS\\nFor all practical purposes, the wing’s lift in a\\nsteady state normal climb is the same as it is in a\\nsteady level flight at the same airspeed. Though the\\nairplane’s flightpath has changed when the climb\\nhas been established, the angle of attack of the\\nwing with respect to the inclined flightpath reverts\\nto practically the same values, as does the lift.\\nThere is an initial momentary change, however, as\\nshown in figure 3-22. During the transition from\\nstraight-and-level flight to a climb, a change in lift\\noccurs when back elevator pressure is first applied.\\nRaising the airplane’s nose increases the angle of\\nattack and momentarily increases the lift. Lift at\\nthis moment is now greater than weight and starts\\nthe airplane climbing. After the flightpath is stabi-\\nlized on the upward incline, the angle of attack and\\nlift again revert to about the level flight values.\\nIf the climb is entered with no change in power set-\\nting, the airspeed gradually diminishes because the\\nthrust required to maintain a given airspeed in level\\nflight is insufficient to maintain the same airspeed\\nin a climb. When the flightpath is inclined upward,\\na component of the airplane’s weight acts in the\\nsame direction as, and parallel to, the total drag of\\nthe airplane, thereby increasing the total effective\\ndrag. Consequently, the total drag is greater than the\\npower, and the airspeed decreases. The reduction in\\nairspeed gradually results in a corresponding\\ndecrease in drag until the total drag (including the\\ncomponent of weight acting in the same direction)\\nequals the thrust. [Figure 3-23] Due to momentum,\\nthe change in airspeed is gradual, varying consider-\\nably with differences in airplane size, weight, total\\ndrag, and other factors.\\nFigure 3-23. Changes in speed during climb entry.\\nGenerally, the forces of thrust and drag, and lift\\nand weight, again become balanced when the air-\\nspeed stabilizes but at a value lower than in\\nstraight-and-level flight at the same power setting.\\nSince in a climb the airplane’s weight is not only\\nacting downward but rearward along with drag,\\nadditional power is required to maintain the same\\nairspeed as in level flight. The amount of power\\ndepends on the angle of climb. When the climb is\\nestablished so steep that there is insufficient power\\navailable, a slower speed results. It will be seen\\nthen that the amount of reserve power determines\\nthe climb performance of the airplane.\\nFORCES IN DESCENTS\\nAs in climbs, the forces acting on the airplane go\\nthrough definite changes when a descent is entered\\nfrom straight-and-level flight. The analysis here is\\nthat of descending at the same power as used in\\nstraight-and-level flight.\\nWhen forward pressure is applied to the elevator\\ncontrol to start descending, or the airplane’s nose is\\nallowed to pitch down, the angle of attack is\\ndecreased and, as a result, the lift of the airfoil is\\nreduced.

The change to a\\ndownward flightpath is due to the lift momentarily\\nbecoming less than the weight of the airplane as the\\nangle of attack is reduced. This imbalance between\\nlift and weight causes the airplane to follow a\\ndescending flightpath with respect to the horizontal\\nflightpath of straight-and-level flight. When the\\nflightpath is in a steady descent, the airfoil’s angle\\nof attack again approaches the original value, and\\nlift and weight will again become stabilized. From\\nthe time the descent is started until it is stabilized,\\nthe airspeed will gradually increase. This is due to a\\ncomponent of weight now acting forward along the\\nflightpath, similar to the manner it acted rearward\\nin a climb. The overall effect is that of increased\\npower or thrust, which in turn causes the increase\\nin airspeed associated with descending at the same\\npower as used in level flight.\\nTo descend at the same airspeed as used in straight-\\nand-level flight, obviously, the power must be reduced\\nas the descent is entered. The component of weight\\nacting forward along the flightpath will increase as\\nthe angle of rate of descent increases and conversely,\\nwill decrease as the angle of rate of descent\\ndecreases. Therefore, the amount of power reduction\\nrequired for a descent at the same speed as cruise\\nwill be determined by the steepness of the descent.\\nSTALLS\\nAn airplane will fly as long as the wing is creating\\nsufficient lift to counteract the load imposed on it.\\nWhen the lift is completely lost, the airplane stalls.\\nRemember, the direct cause of every stall is an\\nexcessive angle of attack. There are any number of\\nflight maneuvers which may produce an increase in\\nthe angle of attack, but the stall does not occur until\\nthe angle of attack becomes excessive.\\nIt must be emphasized that the stalling speed of a\\nparticular airplane is not a fixed value for all flight\\nsituations. However, a given airplane will always\\nstall at the same angle of attack regardless of air-\\nspeed, weight, load factor, or density altitude. Each\\nairplane has a particular angle of attack where the\\nairflow separates from the upper surface of the wing\\nand the stall occurs. This critical angle of attack\\nvaries from 16° to 20° depending on the airplane’s\\ndesign. But each airplane has only one specific angle\\nof attack where the stall occurs.\\nThere are three situations in which the critical angle\\nof attack can be exceeded: in low-speed flying, in\\nhigh-speed flying, and in turning flight.\\nThe airplane can be stalled in straight-and-level\\nflight by flying too slowly. As the airspeed is being\\ndecreased, the angle of attack must be increased to\\nretain the lift required for maintaining altitude. The\\nslower the airspeed becomes, the more the angle of\\nattack must be increased. Eventually, an angle of\\nattack is reached which will result in the wing not\\nproducing enough lift to support the airplane and it\\nwill start settling. If the airspeed is reduced further,\\nthe airplane will stall, since the angle of attack has\\nexceeded the critical angle and the airflow over the\\nwing is disrupted.\\nIt must be reemphasized here that low speed is not\\nnecessary to produce a stall. The wing can be\\nbrought into an excessive angle of attack at any\\nspeed. For example, take the case of an airplane\\nwhich is in a dive with an airspeed of 200 knots\\nwhen suddenly the pilot pulls back sharply on the\\nelevator control. [Figure 3-24] Because of gravity\\nand centrifugal force, the airplane could not immedi-\\nately alter its flightpath but would merely change its\\nangle of attack abruptly from quite low to very high.\\nSince the flightpath of the airplane in relation to the\\noncoming air determines the direction of the relative\\nwind, the angle of attack is suddenly increased, and\\nthe airplane would quickly reach the stalling angle at\\na speed much greater than the normal stall speed.\\nFigure 3-24. Forces exerted when pulling out of a dive.\\nSimilarly, the stalling speed of an airplane is higher\\nin a level turn than in straight-and-level flight.\\n[Figure 3-25] This is because centrifugal force is\\nadded to the airplane’s weight, and the wing must\\nproduce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance\\nthe load imposed by the combination of centrifugal\\nforce and weight. In a turn, the necessary additional\\nlift is acquired by applying back pressure to the ele-\\nvator control. This increases the wing’s angle of\\nattack, and results in increased lift. The angle of\\nattack must increase as the bank angle increases to\\ncounteract the increasing load caused by centrifugal\\nforce. If at any time during a turn the angle of attack\\nbecomes excessive, the airplane will stall.\\nL\\nCF\\nW\\nL\\nL\\nCF\\nCF CF\\nW\\nW\\nW\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-20'),\n",

To balance the airplane\\naerodynamically, the center of lift is normally\\nlocated aft of the center of gravity. Although this\\nmakes the airplane inherently “nose heavy,”\\ndownwash on the horizontal stabilizer counteracts\\nthis condition. It can be seen then, that at the point\\nof stall when the upward force of the wing’s lift\\nand the downward tail force cease, an unbalanced\\ncondition exists. This allows the airplane to pitch\\ndown abruptly, rotating about its center of gravity.\\nDuring this nose-down attitude, the angle of attack\\ndecreases and the airspeed again increases; hence,\\nthe smooth flow of air over the wing begins again,\\nlift returns, and the airplane is again flying.\\nHowever, considerable altitude may be lost before\\nthis cycle is complete.\\nBASIC PROPELLER PRINCIPLES\\nThe airplane propeller consists of two or more blades\\nand a central hub to which the blades are attached.\\nEach blade of an airplane propeller is essentially a\\nrotating wing. As a result of their construction, the\\npropeller blades are like airfoils and produce forces\\nthat create the thrust to pull, or push, the airplane\\nthrough the air.\\nThe power needed to rotate the propeller blades is\\nfurnished by the engine. The engine rotates the air-\\nfoils of the blades through the air at high speeds, and\\nthe propeller transforms the rotary power of the\\nengine into forward thrust.\\nAn airplane moving through the air creates a drag\\nforce opposing its forward motion. Consequently, if\\nan airplane is to fly, there must be a force applied to\\nit that is equal to the drag, but acting forward. This\\nforce is called “thrust.”\\nA cross section of a typical propeller blade is shown\\nin figure 3-26. This section or blade element is an\\nairfoil comparable to a cross section of an airplane\\nwing. One surface of the blade is cambered or\\ncurved, similar to the upper surface of an airplane\\nwing, while the other surface is flat like the bottom\\nsurface of a wing. The chord line is an imaginary\\nline drawn through the blade from its leading edge\\nto its trailing edge. As in a wing, the leading edge is\\nthe thick edge of the blade that meets the air as the\\npropeller rotates.\\nFigure 3-26. Airfoil sections of propeller blade.\\nBlade angle, usually measured in degrees, is the\\nangle between the chord of the blade and the plane\\nof rotation [figure 3-27] and is measured at a spe-\\ncific point along the length of the blade. Because\\nmost propellers have a flat blade “face,” the chord\\nline is often drawn along the face of the propeller\\nblade. Pitch is not the same as blade angle, but\\nbecause pitch is largely determined by blade angle,\\nthe two terms are often used interchangeably. An\\nincrease or decrease in one is usually associated with\\nan increase or decrease in the other.\\nFigure 3-27. Propeller blade angle.\\nThe pitch of a propeller may be designated in\\ninches. A propeller designated as a “74-48” would\\nbe 74 inches in length and have an effective pitch\\nof 48 inches. The pitch in inches is the distance\\nwhich the propeller would screw through the air in\\none revolution if there were no slippage.\\nFigure 3-25.

In this situation, each\\npropeller blade is turning through the air at an angle\\nof attack that produces relatively little thrust for the\\namount of power required to turn it.\\nTo understand the action of a propeller, consider first\\nits motion, which is both rotational and forward.\\nThus, as shown by the vectors of propeller forces in\\nfigure 3-27, each section of a propeller blade moves\\ndownward and forward. The angle at which this air\\n(relative wind) strikes the propeller blade is its angle\\nof attack. The air deflection produced by this angle\\ncauses the dynamic pressure at the engine side of the\\npropeller blade to be greater than atmospheric, thus\\ncreating thrust.\\nThe shape of the blade also creates thrust, because\\nit is cambered like the airfoil shape of a wing.\\nConsequently, as the air flows past the propeller, the\\npressure on one side is less than that on the other. As in\\na wing, this produces a reaction force in the direction\\nof the lesser pressure. In the case of a wing, the airflow\\nover the wing has less pressure, and the force (lift) is\\nupward. In the case of the propeller, which is mounted\\nin a vertical instead of a horizontal plane, the area\\nof decreased pressure is in front of the propeller,\\nand the force (thrust) is in a forward direction.\\nAerodynamically, then, thrust is the result of the\\npropeller shape and the angle of attack of the blade.\\nAnother way to consider thrust is in terms of the\\nmass of air handled by the propeller. In these\\nterms, thrust is equal to the mass of air handled,\\ntimes the slipstream velocity, minus the velocity\\nof the airplane. The power expended in producing\\nthrust depends on the rate of air mass movement.\\nOn the average, thrust constitutes approximately\\n80 percent of the torque (total horsepower\\nabsorbed by the propeller). The other 20 percent is\\nlost in friction and slippage. For any speed of rota-\\ntion, the horsepower absorbed by the propeller\\nbalances the horsepower delivered by the engine.\\nFor any single revolution of the propeller, the\\namount of air handled depends on the blade angle,\\nwhich determines how big a “bite” of air the pro-\\npeller takes. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent\\nmeans of adjusting the load on the propeller to\\ncontrol the engine r.p.m.\\nThe blade angle is also an excellent method of\\nadjusting the angle of attack of the propeller. On con-\\nstant-speed propellers, the blade angle must be\\nadjusted to provide the most efficient angle of attack\\nat all engine and airplane speeds. Lift versus drag\\ncurves, which are drawn for propellers as well as\\nwings, indicate that the most efficient angle of attack\\nis a small one varying from 2° to 4° positive. The\\nactual blade angle necessary to maintain this small\\nangle of attack varies with the forward speed of the\\nairplane.\\nFixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers are\\ndesigned for best efficiency at one rotation and for-\\nward speed. They are designed for a given airplane\\nand engine combination. A propeller may be used\\nthat provides the maximum propeller efficiency for\\neither takeoff, climb, cruise, or high-speed flight.\\nAny change in these conditions results in lowering\\nthe efficiency of both the propeller and the engine.\\nSince the efficiency of any machine is the ratio of\\nthe useful power output to the actual power input,\\npropeller efficiency is the ratio of thrust horsepower\\nto brake horsepower. Propeller efficiency varies\\nfrom 50 to 87 percent, depending on how much the\\npropeller “slips.”\\nPropeller slip is the difference between the geometric\\npitch of the propeller and its effective pitch.\\n[Figure 3-28] Geometric pitch is the theoretical\\ndistance a propeller should advance in one revolu-\\ntion; effective pitch is the distance it actually\\nadvances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is\\nbased on no slippage, but actual or effective pitch\\nincludes propeller slippage in the air.\\nFigure 3-28. Propeller slippage.\\nThe reason a propeller is “twisted” is that the outer\\nparts of the propeller blades, like all things that turn\\nabout a central point, travel faster than the portions\\nnear the hub.

To put it\\nanother way, propeller blades are twisted to change\\nthe blade angle in proportion to the differences in\\nspeed of rotation along the length of the propeller\\nand thereby keep thrust more nearly equalized along\\nthis length.\\nFigure 3-29. Propeller tips travel faster than hubs.\\nUsually 1° to 4° provides the most efficient lift/drag\\nratio, but in flight the propeller angle of attack of a\\nfixed-pitch propeller will vary—normally from 0° to\\n15°. This variation is caused by changes in the rela-\\ntive airstream which in turn results from changes in\\nairplane speed. In short, propeller angle of attack is\\nthe product of two motions: propeller rotation about\\nits axis and its forward motion.\\nA constant-speed propeller, however, automatically\\nkeeps the blade angle adjusted for maximum effi-\\nciency for most conditions encountered in flight.\\nDuring takeoff, when maximum power and thrust\\nare required, the constant-speed propeller is at a low\\npropeller blade angle or pitch. The low blade angle\\nkeeps the angle of attack small and efficient with\\nrespect to the relative wind. At the same time, it\\nallows the propeller to handle a smaller mass of air\\nper revolution. This light load allows the engine to\\nturn at high r.p.m. and to convert the maximum\\namount of fuel into heat energy in a given time. The\\nhigh r.p.m. also creates maximum thrust; for,\\nalthough the mass of air handled per revolution is\\nsmall, the number of revolutions per minute is many,\\nthe slipstream velocity is high, and with the low air-\\nplane speed, the thrust is maximum.\\nAfter liftoff, as the speed of the airplane increases,\\nthe constant-speed propeller automatically changes\\nto a higher angle (or pitch). Again, the higher blade\\nangle keeps the angle of attack small and efficient\\nwith respect to the relative wind. The higher blade\\nangle increases the mass of air handled per revolu-\\ntion. This decreases the engine r.p.m., reducing fuel\\nconsumption and engine wear, and keeps thrust at a\\nmaximum.\\nAfter the takeoff climb is established in an airplane\\nhaving a controllable-pitch propeller, the pilot\\nreduces the power output of the engine to climb\\npower by first decreasing the manifold pressure and\\nthen increasing the blade angle to lower the r.p.m.\\nAt cruising altitude, when the airplane is in level\\nflight and less power is required than is used in take-\\noff or climb, the pilot again reduces engine power by\\nreducing the manifold pressure and then increasing\\nthe blade angle to decrease the r.p.m. Again, this pro-\\nvides a torque requirement to match the reduced\\nengine power; for, although the mass of air handled\\nper revolution is greater, it is more than offset by a\\ndecrease in slipstream velocity and an increase in\\nairspeed. The angle of attack is still small because\\nthe blade angle has been increased with an increase\\nin airspeed.\\nTORQUE AND P FACTOR\\nTo the pilot, “torque” (the left turning tendency of\\nthe airplane) is made up of four elements which\\ncause or produce a twisting or rotating motion\\naround at least one of the airplane’s three axes. These\\nfour elements are:\\n1. Torque Reaction from Engine and Propeller.\\n2. Corkscrewing Effect of the Slipstream.\\n3. Gyroscopic Action of the Propeller.\\n4.

Torque reaction.\\nWhen the airplane is airborne, this force is acting\\naround the longitudinal axis, tending to make the air-\\nplane roll. To compensate for this, some of the older\\nairplanes are rigged in a manner to create more lift\\non the wing that is being forced downward. The\\nmore modern airplanes are designed with the engine\\noffset to counteract this effect of torque.\\nNOTE—Most United States built aircraft engines\\nrotate the propeller clockwise, as viewed from the\\npilot’s seat. The discussion here is with reference to\\nthose engines.\\nGenerally, the compensating factors are permanently\\nset so that they compensate for this force at cruising\\nspeed, since most of the airplane’s operating lift is at\\nthat speed. However, aileron trim tabs permit further\\nadjustment for other speeds.\\nWhen the airplane’s wheels are on the ground during\\nthe takeoff roll, an additional turning moment\\naround the vertical axis is induced by torque reac-\\ntion. As the left side of the airplane is being forced\\ndown by torque reaction, more weight is being\\nplaced on the left main landing gear. This results in\\nmore ground friction, or drag, on the left tire than on\\nthe right, causing a further turning moment to the\\nleft. The magnitude of this moment is dependent on\\nmany variables. Some of these variables are: (1) size\\nand horsepower of engine, (2) size of propeller and\\nthe r.p.m., (3) size of the airplane, and (4) condition\\nof the ground surface.\\nThis yawing moment on the takeoff roll is corrected\\nby the pilot’s proper use of the rudder or rudder trim.\\nCORKSCREW EFFECT\\nThe high-speed rotation of an airplane propeller\\ngives a corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slip-\\nstream. At high propeller speeds and low forward\\nspeed (as in the takeoffs and approaches to power-\\non stalls), this spiraling rotation is very compact\\nand exerts a strong sideward force on the airplane’s\\nvertical tail surface. [Figure 3-31]\\nWhen this spiraling slipstream strikes the vertical fin\\non the left, it causes a left turning moment about the\\nairplane’s vertical axis. The more compact the spiral,\\nthe more prominent this force is. As the forward\\nspeed increases, however, the spiral elongates and\\nbecomes less effective.\\nThe corkscrew flow of the slipstream also causes a\\nrolling moment around the longitudinal axis.\\nNote that this rolling moment caused by the\\ncorkscrew flow of the slipstream is to the right, while\\nthe rolling moment caused by torque reaction is to\\nthe left—in effect one may be counteracting the\\nother. However, these forces vary greatly and it is up\\nto the pilot to apply proper correction action by use\\nof the flight controls at all times. These forces must\\nbe counteracted regardless of which is the most\\nprominent at the time.\\nGYROSCOPIC ACTION\\nBefore the gyroscopic effects of the propeller can be\\nunderstood, it is necessary to understand the basic\\nprinciple of a gyroscope.\\nAll practical applications of the gyroscope are based\\nupon two fundamental properties of gyroscopic\\naction: rigidity in space and precession. The one of\\ninterest for this discussion is precession.\\nPrecession is the resultant action, or deflection, of a\\nspinning rotor when a deflecting force is applied to\\nits rim. As can be seen in figure 3-32, when a force is\\napplied, the resulting force takes effect 90° ahead of\\nand in the direction of rotation.\\nThe rotating propeller of an airplane makes a very\\ngood gyroscope and thus has similar properties. Any\\ntime a force is applied to deflect the propeller out of\\nits plane of rotation, the resulting force is 90° ahead\\nof and in the direction of rotation and in the direction\\nof application, causing a pitching moment, a yawing\\nmoment, or a combination of the two depending\\nupon the point at which the force was applied.\\nAction\\nReaction\\nProp Rotation\\nYaw\\nSlipstream\\nForce\\nFigure 3-31.

The resultant force\\nacting 90° ahead causes a yawing moment to the\\nleft around the vertical axis. The magnitude of this\\nmoment depends on several variables, one of\\nwhich is the abruptness with which the tail is\\nraised (amount of force applied). However, preces-\\nsion, or gyroscopic action, occurs when a force is\\napplied to any point on the rim of the propeller’s\\nplane of rotation; the resultant force will still be\\n90° from the point of application in the direction\\nof rotation. Depending on where the force is\\napplied, the airplane is caused to yaw left or right,\\nto pitch up or down, or a combination of pitching\\nand yawing.\\nIt can be said that as a result of gyroscopic action—\\nany yawing around the vertical axis results in a\\npitching moment, and any pitching around the lateral\\naxis results in a yawing moment.\\nTo correct for the effect of gyroscopic action, it is\\nnecessary for the pilot to properly use elevator and\\nrudder to prevent undesired pitching and yawing.\\nASYMMETRIC LOADING (P FACTOR)\\nWhen an airplane is flying with a high angle of\\nattack, the “bite” of the downward moving blade is\\ngreater than the “bite” of the upward moving\\nblade; thus moving the center of thrust to the\\nright of the prop disc area—causing a yawing\\nmoment toward the left around the vertical axis.\\nThat explanation is correct; however, to prove\\nthis phenomenon, it would be necessary to work\\nwind vector problems on each blade, which gets\\nquite involved when considering both the angle\\nof attack of the airplane and the angle of attack of\\neach blade.\\nThis asymmetric loading is caused by the resultant\\nvelocity, which is generated by the combination of\\nthe velocity of the propeller blade in its plane of\\nrotation and the velocity of the air passing horizon-\\ntally through the propeller “disc.” With the airplane\\nbeing flown at positive angles of attack, the right\\n(viewed from the rear) or downswinging blade, is\\npassing through an area of resultant velocity which\\nis greater than that affecting the left or upswinging\\nblade. Since the propeller blade is an airfoil,\\nincreased velocity means increased lift. Therefore,\\nthe downswinging blade having more “lift” tends\\nto pull (yaw) the airplane’s nose to the left.\\nSimply stated, when the airplane is flying at a high\\nangle of attack, the downward moving blade has a\\nhigher resultant velocity; therefore creating more lift\\nthan the upward moving blade. [Figure 3-34] This\\nmight be easier to visualize if the propeller shaft was\\nmounted perpendicular to the ground (like a\\nhelicopter). If there were no air movement at\\nall, except that generated by the propeller\\nitself, identical sections of each blade would\\nhave the same airspeed. However, with air mov-\\ning horizontally across this vertically mounted\\npropeller, the blade proceeding forward into the\\nflow of air will have a higher airspeed than the\\nblade retreating with the airflow.

To\\nbecome a pilot, a detailed technical course in the\\nscience of aerodynamics is not necessary. However,\\nwith responsibilities for the safety of passengers, the\\ncompetent pilot must have a well-founded concept of\\nthe forces which act on the airplane, and the advanta-\\ngeous use of these forces, as well as the operating\\nlimitations of the particular airplane. Any force\\napplied to an airplane to deflect its flight from a\\nstraight line produces a stress on its structure; the\\namount of this force is termed “load factor.”\\nA load factor is the ratio of the total airload acting on\\nthe airplane to the gross weight of the airplane. For\\nexample, a load factor of 3 means that the total load\\non an airplane’s structure is three times its gross\\nweight. Load factors are usually expressed in terms\\nof “G”—that is, a load factor of 3 may be spoken of\\nas 3 G’s, or a load factor of 4 as 4 G’s.\\nIt is interesting to note that in subjecting an airplane\\nto 3 G’s in a pullup from a dive, one will be pressed\\ndown into the seat with a force equal to three times\\nthe person’s weight. Thus, an idea of the magnitude\\nof the load factor obtained in any maneuver can be\\ndetermined by considering the degree to which one\\nis pressed down into the seat. Since the operating\\nspeed of modern airplanes has increased signifi-\\ncantly, this effect has become so pronounced that it\\nis a primary consideration in the design of the\\nstructure for all airplanes.\\nWith the structural design of airplanes planned to\\nwithstand only a certain amount of overload, a\\nknowledge of load factors has become essential for\\nall pilots. Load factors are important to the pilot for\\ntwo distinct reasons:\\n1. Because of the obviously dangerous overload that\\nis possible for a pilot to impose on the airplane\\nstructures; and\\n2. Because an increased load factor increases the\\nstalling speed and makes stalls possible at seem-\\ningly safe flight speeds.\\nLOAD FACTORS IN AIRPLANE DESIGN\\nThe answer to the question “how strong should an\\nairplane be” is determined largely by the use to which\\nthe airplane will be subjected. This is a difficult prob-\\nlem, because the maximum possible loads are much\\ntoo high for use in efficient design. It is true that any\\npilot can make a very hard landing or an extremely\\nsharp pullup from a dive, which would result in\\nabnormal loads. However, such extremely abnormal\\nloads must be dismissed somewhat if airplanes are\\nbuilt that will take off quickly, land slowly, and carry\\na worthwhile payload.\\nThe problem of load factors in airplane design then\\nreduces to that of determining the highest load fac-\\ntors that can be expected in normal operation under\\nvarious operational situations. These load factors\\nare called “limit load factors.” For reasons of\\nsafety, it is required that the airplane be designed to\\nwithstand these load factors without any structural\\ndamage. Although the Code of Federal Regulations\\nrequires that the airplane structure be capable of\\nsupporting one and one-half times these limit load\\nfactors without failure, it is accepted that parts of\\nthe airplane may bend or twist under these loads\\nand that some structural damage may occur.\\nThis 1.5 value is called the “factor of safety” and\\nprovides, to some extent, for loads higher than those\\nexpected under normal and reasonable operation.\\nHowever, this strength reserve is not something\\nwhich pilots should willfully abuse; rather it is there\\nfor their protection when they encounter unexpected\\nconditions.\\nThe above considerations apply to all loading con-\\nditions, whether they be due to gusts, maneuvers, or\\nlandings. The gust load factor requirements now in\\neffect are substantially the same as those that have\\nbeen in existence for years. Hundreds of thousands\\nof operational hours have proven them adequate for\\nsafety. Since the pilot has little control over gust\\nload factors (except to reduce the airplane’s speed\\nwhen rough air is encountered), the gust loading\\nrequirements are substantially the same for most\\ngeneral aviation type airplanes regardless of their\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-26'),\n",

Generally, the gust load factors con-\\ntrol the design of airplanes which are intended for\\nstrictly nonacrobatic usage.\\nAn entirely different situation exists in airplane\\ndesign with maneuvering load factors. It is necessary\\nto discuss this matter separately with respect to: (1)\\nAirplanes which are designed in accordance with the\\nCategory System (i.e., Normal, Utility, Acrobatic);\\nand (2) Airplanes of older design which were built to\\nrequirements which did not provide for operational\\ncategories.\\nAirplanes designed under the Category System are\\nreadily identified by a placard in the cockpit, which\\nstates the operational category (or categories) in\\nwhich the airplane is certificated. The maximum safe\\nload factors (limit load factors) specified for air-\\nplanes in the various categories are as follows:\\nCATEGORY LIMIT LOAD\\nNormal1 3.8 to –1.52\\nUtility (mild acrobatics, including spins)   4.4 to –1.76\\nAcrobatic 6.0 to –3.0 \\n1 For airplanes with gross weight of more than 4,000\\npounds, the limit load factor is reduced. To the limit\\nloads given above, a safety factor of 50 percent is\\nadded.\\nThere is an upward graduation in load factor with the\\nincreasing severity of maneuvers. The Category\\nSystem provides for obtaining the maximum utility\\nof an airplane. If normal operation alone is intended,\\nthe required load factor (and consequently the\\nweight of the airplane) is less than if the airplane is\\nto be employed in training or acrobatic maneuvers as\\nthey result in higher maneuvering loads.\\nAirplanes that do not have the category placard are\\ndesigns that were constructed under earlier engineer-\\ning requirements in which no operational restrictions\\nwere specifically given to the pilots. For airplanes of\\nthis type (up to weights of about 4,000 pounds) the\\nrequired strength is comparable to present-day util-\\nity category airplanes, and the same types of opera-\\ntion are permissible. For airplanes of this type over\\n4,000 pounds, the load factors decrease with weight\\nso that these airplanes should be regarded as being\\ncomparable to the normal category airplanes\\ndesigned under the Category System, and they\\nshould be operated accordingly.\\nLOAD FACTORS IN STEEP TURNS\\nIn a constant altitude, coordinated turn in any air-\\nplane, the load factor is the result of two forces:\\ncentrifugal force and gravity. [Figure 3-35] For any\\ngiven bank angle, the rate of turn varies with the\\nairspeed; the higher the speed, the slower the rate of\\nturn. This compensates for added centrifugal force,\\nallowing the load factor to remain the same.Figure 3-35. Two forces cause load factor during turns.\\nFigure 3-36 reveals an important fact about turns—\\nthat the load factor increases at a terrific rate after a\\nbank has reached 45° or 50°. The load factor for\\nany airplane in a 60° bank is 2 G’s. The load factor\\nin an 80° bank is 5.76 G’s. The wing must produce\\nlift equal to these load factors if altitude is to be\\nmaintained.\\nFigure 3-36.

This bank and its resultant\\nnecessary power setting reach the limit of this type\\nof airplane. An additional 10° bank will increase the\\nload factor by approximately 1 G, bringing it close\\nto the yield point established for these airplanes.\\n[Figure 3-36]\\nLOAD FACTORS AND STALLING SPEEDS\\nAny airplane, within the limits of its structure, may\\nbe stalled at any airspeed. When a sufficiently high\\nangle of attack is imposed, the smooth flow of air\\nover an airfoil breaks up and separates, producing an\\nabrupt change of flight characteristics and a sudden\\nloss of lift, which results in a stall.\\nA study of this effect has revealed that the airplane’s\\nstalling speed increases in proportion to the square\\nroot of the load factor. This means that an airplane\\nwith a normal unaccelerated stalling speed of 50\\nknots can be stalled at 100 knots by inducing a load\\nfactor of 4 G’s. If it were possible for this airplane to\\nwithstand a load factor of 9, it could be stalled at a\\nspeed of 150 knots. Therefore, a competent pilot\\nshould be aware of the following:\\n• The danger of inadvertently stalling the airplane\\nby increasing the load factor, as in a steep turn or\\nspiral; and\\n• That in intentionally stalling an airplane above its\\ndesign maneuvering speed, a tremendous load\\nfactor is imposed.\\nReference to the charts in figures 3-36 and 3-37 will\\nshow that by banking the airplane to just beyond 72°\\nin a steep turn produces a load factor of 3, and the\\nstalling speed is increased significantly. If this turn is\\nmade in an airplane with a normal unaccelerated\\nstalling speed of 45 knots, the airspeed must be kept\\nabove 75 knots to prevent inducing a stall. A similar\\neffect is experienced in a quick pullup, or any\\nmaneuver producing load factors above 1 G. This\\nhas been the cause of accidents resulting from a sud-\\nden, unexpected loss of control, particularly in a\\nsteep turn or abrupt application of the back elevator\\ncontrol near the ground.\\nSince the load factor squares as the stalling speed\\ndoubles, it may be realized that tremendous loads\\nmay be imposed on structures by stalling an airplane\\nat relatively high airspeeds.\\nThe maximum speed at which an airplane may be\\nstalled safely is now determined for all new designs.\\nThis speed is called the “design maneuvering\\nspeed” (V\\nA) and is required to be entered in the\\nFAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nOperating Handbook (AFM/POH) of all recently\\ndesigned airplanes. For older general aviation air-\\nplanes, this speed will be approximately 1.7 times\\nthe normal stalling speed. Thus, an older airplane\\nwhich normally stalls at 60 knots must never be\\nstalled at above 102 knots (60 knots x 1.7 = 102\\nknots). An airplane with a normal stalling speed of\\nFigure 3-37.

(The above\\nfigures are an approximation to be considered as a\\nguide and are not the exact answers to any set of\\nproblems. The design maneuvering speed should be\\ndetermined from the particular airplane’s operating\\nlimitations when provided by the manufacturer.)\\nSince the leverage in the control system varies\\nwith different airplanes and some types employ\\n“balanced” control surfaces while others do not,\\nthe pressure exerted by the pilot on the controls\\ncannot be accepted as an index of the load factors\\nproduced in different airplanes. In most cases, load\\nfactors can be judged by the experienced pilot from\\nthe feel of seat pressure. They can also be meas-\\nured by an instrument called an “accelerometer,”\\nbut since this instrument is not common in general\\naviation training airplanes, the development of the\\nability to judge load factors from the feel of their\\neffect on the body is important. A knowledge of\\nthe principles outlined above is essential to the\\ndevelopment of this ability to estimate load factors.\\nA thorough knowledge of load factors induced by\\nvarying degrees of bank, and the significance of\\ndesign maneuvering speed (V\\nA) will aid in the pre-\\nvention of two of the most serious types of accidents:\\n1. Stalls from steep turns or excessive maneuvering\\nnear the ground; and\\n2. Structural failures during acrobatics or other vio-\\nlent maneuvers resulting from loss of control.\\nLOAD FACTORS AND FLIGHT MANEUVERS\\nCritical load factors apply to all flight maneuvers\\nexcept unaccelerated straight flight where a load\\nfactor of 1 G is always present. Certain maneuvers\\nconsidered in this section are known to involve rel-\\natively high load factors.\\nTURNS\\n— Increased load factors are a characteristic\\nof all banked turns. As noted in the section on load\\nfactors in steep turns and particularly figures 3-36\\nand 3-37, load factors become significant both to\\nflight performance and to the load on wing structure\\nas the bank increases beyond approximately 45°.\\nThe yield factor of the average light plane is reached at\\na bank of approximately 70° to 75°, and the stalling\\nspeed is increased by approximately one-half at a bank\\nof approximately 63°.\\nSTALLS— The normal stall entered from straight\\nlevel flight, or an unaccelerated straight climb, will\\nnot produce added load factors beyond the 1 G of\\nstraight-and-level flight. As the stall occurs, how-\\never, this load factor may be reduced toward zero,\\nthe factor at which nothing seems to have weight;\\nand the pilot has the feeling of “floating free in\\nspace.” In the event recovery is effected by snapping\\nthe elevator control forward, negative load factors,\\nthose which impose a down load on the wings and\\nraise the pilot from the seat, may be produced.\\nDuring the pullup following stall recovery, significant\\nload factors sometimes are induced. Inadvertently\\nthese may be further increased during excessive div-\\ning (and consequently high airspeed) and abrupt\\npullups to level flight. One usually leads to the other,\\nthus increasing the load factor. Abrupt pullups at high\\ndiving speeds may impose critical loads on airplane\\nstructures and may produce recurrent or secondary\\nstalls by increasing the angle of attack to that of\\nstalling.\\nAs a generalization, a recovery from a stall made\\nby diving only to cruising or design maneuvering\\nairspeed, with a gradual pullup as soon as the air-\\nspeed is safely above stalling, can be effected with\\na load factor not to exceed 2 or 2.5 G’s. A higher\\nload factor should never be necessary unless\\nrecovery has been effected with the airplane’s nose\\nnear or beyond the vertical attitude, or at extremely\\nlow altitudes to avoid diving into the ground.\\nSPINS\\n— Since a stabilized spin is not essentially\\ndifferent from a stall in any element other than\\nrotation, the same load factor considerations apply\\nas those that apply to stall recovery. Since spin\\nrecoveries usually are effected with the nose much\\nlower than is common in stall recoveries, higher\\nairspeeds and consequently higher load factors are\\nto be expected. The load factor in a proper spin\\nrecovery will usually be found to be about 2.5 G’s.\\nThe load factor during a spin will vary with the spin\\ncharacteristics of each airplane but is usually found\\nto be slightly above the 1 G of level flight. There are\\ntwo reasons this is true:\\n1. The airspeed in a spin is very low, usually within\\n2 knots of the unaccelerated stalling speeds; and\\n2. The airplane pivots, rather than turns, while it is\\nin a spin.\\nHIGH-SPEED STALLS— The average light plane\\nis not built to withstand the repeated application of\\nload factors common to high-speed stalls. The load\\nfactor necessary for these maneuvers produces a\\nstress on the wings and tail structure, which does not\\nleave a reasonable margin of safety in most light air-\\nplanes.\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-29'),\n",

A speed of 1.7\\ntimes stalling speed (about 102 knots in a light air-\\nplane with a stalling speed of 60 knots) will produce\\na load factor of 3 G’s. Further, only a very narrow\\nmargin for error can be allowed for acrobatics in\\nlight airplanes. To illustrate how rapidly the load\\nfactor increases with airspeed, a high-speed stall at\\n112 knots in the same airplane would produce a load\\nfactor of 4 G’s.\\nCHANDELLES AND LAZY EIGHTS\\n— It would\\nbe difficult to make a definite statement concerning\\nload factors in these maneuvers as both involve\\nsmooth, shallow dives and pullups. The load factors\\nincurred depend directly on the speed of the dives\\nand the abruptness of the pullups.\\nGenerally, the better the maneuver is performed, the\\nless extreme will be the load factor induced. A chan-\\ndelle or lazy eight, in which the pullup produces a\\nload factor greater than 2 G’s will not result in as\\ngreat a gain in altitude, and in low-powered airplanes\\nit may result in a net loss of altitude.\\nThe smoothest pullup possible, with a moderate\\nload factor, will deliver the greatest gain in altitude\\nin a chandelle and will result in a better overall\\nperformance in both chandelles and lazy eights.\\nFurther, it will be noted that recommended entry\\nspeed for these maneuvers is generally near the\\nmanufacturer’s design maneuvering speed, thereby\\nallowing maximum development of load factors\\nwithout exceeding the load limits.\\nROUGH AIR\\n— All certificated airplanes are\\ndesigned to withstand loads imposed by gusts of\\nconsiderable intensity. Gust load factors increase\\nwith increasing airspeed and the strength used for\\ndesign purposes usually corresponds to the highest\\nlevel flight speed. In extremely rough air, as in thun-\\nderstorms or frontal conditions, it is wise to reduce\\nthe speed to the design maneuvering speed.\\nRegardless of the speed held, there may be gusts that\\ncan produce loads which exceed the load limits.\\nMost airplane flight manuals now include turbulent\\nair penetration information. Operators of modern\\nairplanes, capable of a wide range of speeds and\\naltitudes, are benefited by this added feature both in\\ncomfort and safety. In this connection, it is to be\\nnoted that the maximum “never-exceed” placard\\ndive speeds are determined for smooth air only.\\nHigh-speed dives or acrobatics involving speed\\nabove the known maneuvering speed should never\\nbe practiced in rough or turbulent air.\\nIn summary, it must be remembered that load factors\\ninduced by intentional acrobatics, abrupt pullups\\nfrom dives, high-speed stalls, and gusts at high air-\\nspeeds all place added stress on the entire structure\\nof an airplane.\\nStress on the structure involves forces on any part of\\nthe airplane. There is a tendency for the uninformed\\nto think of load factors only in terms of their effect\\non spars and struts. Most structural failures due to\\nexcess load factors involve rib structure within the\\nleading and trailing edges of wings and tail group.\\nThe critical area of fabric-covered airplanes is the\\ncovering about one-third of the chord aft on the top\\nsurface of the wing.\\nThe cumulative effect of such loads over a long\\nperiod of time may tend to loosen and weaken vital\\nparts so that actual failure may occur later when the\\nairplane is being operated in a normal manner.\\nVG DIAGRAM\\nThe flight operating strength of an airplane is pre-\\nsented on a graph whose horizontal scale is based on\\nload factor. [Figure 3-38] The diagram is called a Vg\\ndiagram—velocity versus “g” loads or load factor.\\nEach airplane has its own Vg diagram which is valid\\nat a certain weight and altitude.\\nThe lines of maximum lift capability (curved lines)\\nare the first items of importance on the Vg diagram.\\nThe subject airplane in the illustration is capable of\\ndeveloping no more than one positive “g” at 62\\nm.p.h., the wing level stall speed of the airplane.\\nSince the maximum load factor varies with the\\nsquare of the airspeed, the maximum positive lift\\ncapability of this airplane is 2 “g” at 92 m.p.h., 3\\n“g” at 112 m.p.h., 4.4 “g” at 137 m.p.h., and so\\nforth. Any load factor above this line is unavailable\\naerodynamically; i.e., the subject airplane cannot\\nfly above the line of maximum lift capability (it\\nwill stall). Essentially the same situation exists for\\nnegative lift flight with the exception that the speed\\nnecessary to produce a given negative load factor is\\nhigher than that to produce the same positive load\\nfactor.\\nIf the subject airplane is flown at a positive load\\nfactor greater than the positive limit load factor of\\n4.4, structural damage will be possible. When the\\nairplane is operated in this region, objectionable\\npermanent deformation of the primary structure\\nmay take place and a high rate of fatigue damage is\\nincurred.

The airspeed at this point is the minimum\\nairspeed at which the limit load can be developed\\naerodynamically. Any airspeed greater than this pro-\\nvides a positive lift capability sufficient to damage\\nthe airplane; any airspeed less does not provide\\npositive lift capability sufficient to cause damage\\nfrom excessive flight loads. The usual term given to\\nthis speed is “maneuvering speed,” since consideration\\nof subsonic aerodynamics would predict minimum\\nusable turn radius to occur at this condition. The\\nmaneuver speed is a valuable reference point, since an\\nairplane operating below this point cannot produce a\\ndamaging positive flight load.

If flight is attempted beyond\\nthe limit airspeed, structural damage or structural\\nfailure may result from a variety of phenomena.\\nThus, the airplane in flight is limited to a regime of\\nairspeeds and g’s which do not exceed the limit (or\\nredline) speed, do not exceed the limit load factor,\\nand cannot exceed the maximum lift capability. The\\nairplane must be operated within this “envelope” to\\nprevent structural damage and ensure that the antic-\\nipated service lift of the airplane is obtained. The\\npilot must appreciate the Vg diagram as describing\\nthe allowable combination of airspeeds and load\\nfactors for safe operation. Any maneuver, gust, or\\ngust plus maneuver outside the structural envelope\\ncan cause structural damage and effectively shorten\\nthe service life of the airplane.\\nWEIGHT AND BALANCE\\nOften a pilot regards the airplane’s weight and balance\\ndata as information of interest only to engineers,\\ndispatchers, and operators of scheduled and non-\\nscheduled air carriers.

Further, this information is mistakenly\\nreduced to a workable routine or “rule of thumb”\\nsuch as: “If I have three passengers, I can load only\\n100 gallons of fuel; four passengers—70 gallons.”\\nFigure 3-38.

The importance of the CG should have become\\napparent in the discussion of stability, controllability,\\nand performance. If all pilots understood and\\nrespected the effect of CG on an airplane, then one\\ntype of accident would be eliminated from the\\nrecords: “PRIMARY CAUSE OF ACCIDENT—\\nAIRPLANE CENTER OF GRAVITY OUT OF\\nREARWARD LIMITS AND UNEQUAL LOAD\\nDISTRIBUTION RESULTING IN AN UNSTABLE\\nAIRPLANE. PILOT LOST CONTROL OF AIR-\\nPLANE ON TAKEOFF AND CRASHED.”\\nThe reasons airplanes are so certificated are obvious\\nwhen one gives it a little thought. For instance, it is\\nof added value to the pilot to be able to carry extra\\nfuel for extended flights when the full complement\\nof passengers is not to be carried. Further, it is unrea-\\nsonable to forbid the carriage of baggage when it is\\nonly during spins that its weight will adversely affect\\nthe airplane’s flight characteristics. Weight and bal-\\nance limits are placed on airplanes for two principal\\nreasons:\\n1. Because of the effect of the weight on the air-\\nplane’s primary structure and its performance\\ncharacteristics; and\\n2. Because of the effect the location of this weight\\nhas on flight characteristics, particularly in stall\\nand spin recovery and stability.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT ON \\nFLIGHT PERFORMANCE\\nThe takeoff/climb and landing performance of an\\nairplane are determined on the basis of its maximum\\nallowable takeoff and landing weights. A heavier\\ngross weight will result in a longer takeoff run and\\nshallower climb, and a faster touchdown speed and\\nlonger landing roll. Even a minor overload may\\nmake it impossible for the airplane to clear an obsta-\\ncle that normally would not have been seriously\\nconsidered during takeoffs under more favorable\\nconditions.\\nThe detrimental effects of overloading on performance\\nare not limited to the immediate hazards involving\\ntakeoffs and landings. Overloading has an adverse\\neffect on all climb and cruise performance which leads\\nto overheating during climbs, added wear on engine\\nparts, increased fuel consumption, slower cruising\\nspeeds, and reduced range.\\nThe manufacturers of modern airplanes furnish\\nweight and balance data with each airplane produced.\\nGenerally, this information may be found in the FAA-\\napproved Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s Operating\\nHandbook (AFM/POH). With the advancements in\\nairplane design and construction in recent years has\\ncome the development of “easy to read charts” for\\ndetermining weight and balance data. Increased\\nperformance and load carrying capability of these\\nairplanes require strict adherence to the operating\\nlimitations prescribed by the manufacturer.\\nDeviations from the recommendations can result in\\nstructural damage or even complete failure of the\\nairplane’s structure. Even if an airplane is loaded\\nwell within the maximum weight limitations, it is\\nimperative that weight distribution be within the\\nlimits of center of gravity location. The preceding\\nbrief study of aerodynamics and load factors points\\nout the reasons for this precaution. The following\\ndiscussion is background information into some of\\nthe reasons why weight and balance conditions are\\nimportant to the safe flight of an airplane.\\nThe pilot is often completely unaware of the weight\\nand balance limitations of the airplane being flown\\nand of the reasons for these limitations. In some air-\\nplanes, it is not possible to fill all seats, baggage\\ncompartments, and fuel tanks, and still remain\\nwithin approved weight or balance limits. As an\\nexample, in several popular four-place airplanes the\\nfuel tanks may not be filled to capacity when four\\noccupants and their baggage are carried. In a certain\\ntwo-place airplane, no baggage may be carried in\\nthe compartment aft of the seats when spins are to\\nbe practiced.\\nEFFECT OF WEIGHT ON \\nAIRPLANE STRUCTURE\\nThe effect of additional weight on the wing structure\\nof an airplane is not readily apparent. Airworthiness\\nrequirements prescribe that the structure of an air-\\nplane certificated in the normal category (in which\\nacrobatics are prohibited) must be strong enough\\nto withstand a load factor of 3.8 to take care of\\ndynamic loads caused by maneuvering and gusts.\\nThis means that the primary structure of the airplane\\ncan withstand a load of 3.8 times the approved gross\\nweight of the airplane without structural failure\\noccurring. If this is accepted as indicative of the\\nload factors that may be imposed during operations\\nfor which the airplane is intended, a 100-pound\\noverload imposes a potential structural overload\\nof 380 pounds. The same consideration is even\\nmore impressive in the case of utility and acrobatic\\ncategory airplanes, which have load factor\\nrequirements of 4.4 and 6.0 respectively.\\nStructural failures which result from overloading\\nmay be dramatic and catastrophic, but more often\\nthey affect structural components progressively in a\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-32'),\n",

One of the most serious results of habitual\\noverloading is that its results tend to be cumulative,\\nand may result in structural failure later during com-\\npletely normal operations. The additional stress\\nplaced on structural parts by overloading is believed to\\naccelerate the occurrence of metallic fatigue failures.\\nA knowledge of load factors imposed by flight\\nmaneuvers and gusts will emphasize the conse-\\nquences of an increase in the gross weight of an\\nairplane. The structure of an airplane about to\\nundergo a load factor of 3 G’s, as in the recovery\\nfrom a steep dive, must be prepared to withstand\\nan added load of 300 pounds for each 100-pound\\nincrease in weight. It should be noted that this\\nwould be imposed by the addition of about 16 gallons\\nof unneeded fuel in a particular airplane. The FAA\\ncertificated civil airplane has been analyzed struc-\\nturally, and tested for flight at the maximum gross\\nweight authorized and within the speeds posted for\\nthe type of flights to be performed. Flights at weights\\nin excess of this amount are quite possible and often\\nare well within the performance capabilities of an\\nairplane. Nonetheless, this fact should not be\\nallowed to mislead the pilot, as the pilot may not\\nrealize that loads for which the airplane was not\\ndesigned are being imposed on all or some part of\\nthe structure.\\nIn loading an airplane with either passengers or\\ncargo, the structure must be considered. Seats,\\nbaggage compartments, and cabin floors are\\ndesigned for a certain load or concentration of\\nload and no more. As an example, a light plane\\nbaggage compartment may be placarded for 20\\npounds because of the limited strength of its sup-\\nporting structure even though the airplane may not\\nbe overloaded or out of center-of-gravity limits\\nwith more weight at that location.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT ON \\nSTABILITY AND CONTROLLABILITY\\nThe effects that overloading has on stability also are\\nnot generally recognized. An airplane, which is\\nobserved to be quite stable and controllable when\\nloaded normally, may be discovered to have very\\ndifferent flight characteristics when it is overloaded.\\nAlthough the distribution of weight has the most\\ndirect effect on this, an increase in the airplane’s\\ngross weight may be expected to have an adverse\\neffect on stability, regardless of location of the\\ncenter of gravity.\\nThe stability of many certificated airplanes is com-\\npletely unsatisfactory if the gross weight is\\nexceeded.\\nEFFECT OF LOAD DISTRIBUTION\\nThe effect of the position of the center of gravity\\non the load imposed on an airplane’s wing in flight\\nis not generally realized, although it may be very\\nsignificant to climb and cruising performance.\\nContrary to the beliefs of some pilots, an airplane\\nwith forward loading is “heavier” and conse-\\nquently, slower than the same airplane with the\\ncenter of gravity further aft.\\nFigure 3-39 illustrates the reason for this. With forward\\nloading, “nose-up” trim is required in most airplanes\\nto maintain level cruising flight. Nose-up trim\\ninvolves setting the tail surfaces to produce a\\ngreater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage,\\nwhich adds to the wing loading and the total lift\\nrequired from the wing if altitude is to be main-\\ntained. This requires a higher angle of attack of\\nthe wing, which results in more drag and, in turn,\\nproduces a higher stalling speed.\\nFigure 3-39. Load distribution affects balance.\\nWith aft loading and “nose-down” trim, the tail sur-\\nfaces will exert less down load, relieving the wing of\\nthat much wing loading and lift required to maintain\\naltitude. The required angle of attack of the wing is\\nless, so the drag is less, allowing for a faster cruise\\nspeed. Theoretically, a neutral load on the tail surfaces\\nin cruising flight would produce the most efficient\\noverall performance and fastest cruising speed, but\\nwould also result in instability. Consequently, modern\\nairplanes are designed to require a down load on the\\ntail for stability and controllability.\\nRemember that a zero indication on the trim tab con-\\ntrol is not necessarily the same as “neutral trim”\\nbecause of the force exerted by downwash from the\\nwings and the fuselage on the tail surfaces.\\nThe effects of the distribution of the airplane’s use-\\nful load have a significant influence on its flight\\nCenter\\nof Lift\\nCenter\\nof Lift\\nLoad Imposed\\nby Tail\\nGross Weight\\nForward\\nCG Load Imposed\\nby Tail\\nGross Weight\\nAFT CG\\nStronger\\nDown Load\\non Tail\\nLighter\\nDown Load\\non Tail\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-33'),\n",

Important among these effects are\\nchanges in controllability, stability, and the actual\\nload imposed on the wing.\\nGenerally, an airplane becomes less controllable,\\nespecially at slow flight speeds, as the center of\\ngravity is moved further aft. An airplane which\\ncleanly recovers from a prolonged spin with the\\ncenter of gravity at one position may fail completely\\nto respond to normal recovery attempts when the\\ncenter of gravity is moved aft by 1 or 2 inches.\\nIt is common practice for airplane designers to\\nestablish an aft center-of-gravity limit that is within\\n1 inch of the maximum which will allow normal\\nrecovery from a one-turn spin. When certificating\\nan airplane in the utility category to permit inten-\\ntional spins, the aft center-of-gravity limit is usually\\nestablished at a point several inches forward of that\\nwhich is permissible for certification in the normal\\ncategory.\\nAnother factor affecting controllability, which is\\nbecoming more important in current designs of large\\nairplanes, is the effect of long moment arms to the\\npositions of heavy equipment and cargo. The same\\nairplane may be loaded to maximum gross weight\\nwithin its center-of-gravity limits by concentrating\\nfuel, passengers, and cargo near the design center of\\ngravity; or by dispersing fuel and cargo loads in\\nwingtip tanks and cargo bins forward and aft of the\\ncabin.\\nWith the same total weight and center of gravity,\\nmaneuvering the airplane or maintaining level flight\\nin turbulent air will require the application of greater\\ncontrol forces when the load is dispersed. This is true\\nbecause of the longer moment arms to the positions of\\nthe heavy fuel and cargo loads which must be over-\\ncome by the action of the control surfaces. An airplane\\nwith full outboard wing tanks or tip tanks tends to be\\nsluggish in roll when control situations are marginal,\\nwhile one with full nose and aft cargo bins tends to be\\nless responsive to the elevator controls.\\nThe rearward center-of-gravity limit of an airplane is\\ndetermined largely by considerations of stability.\\nThe original airworthiness requirements for a type\\ncertificate specify that an airplane in flight at a cer-\\ntain speed will dampen out vertical displacement\\nof the nose within a certain number of oscillations.\\nAn airplane loaded too far rearward may not do\\nthis; instead when the nose is momentarily pulled\\nup, it may alternately climb and dive becoming\\nsteeper with each oscillation. This instability is not\\nonly uncomfortable to occupants, but it could even\\nbecome dangerous by making the airplane unman-\\nageable under certain conditions.\\nThe recovery from a stall in any airplane becomes\\nprogressively more difficult as its center of gravity\\nmoves aft. This is particularly important in spin\\nrecovery, as there is a point in rearward loading of\\nany airplane at which a “flat” spin will develop. A\\nflat spin is one in which centrifugal force, acting\\nthrough a center of gravity located well to the rear,\\nwill pull the tail of the airplane out away from the\\naxis of the spin, making it impossible to get the nose\\ndown and recover.\\nAn airplane loaded to the rear limit of its permissible\\ncenter-of-gravity range will handle differently in\\nturns and stall maneuvers and have different landing\\ncharacteristics than when it is loaded near the for-\\nward limit.\\nThe forward center-of-gravity limit is determined by\\na number of considerations. As a safety measure, it\\nis required that the trimming device, whether tab or\\nadjustable stabilizer, be capable of holding the air-\\nplane in a normal glide with the power off. A con-\\nventional airplane must be capable of a full stall,\\npower-off landing in order to ensure minimum land-\\ning speed in emergencies. A tailwheel-type airplane\\nloaded excessively nose heavy will be difficult to\\ntaxi, particularly in high winds. It can be nosed over\\neasily by use of the brakes, and it will be difficult to\\nland without bouncing since it tends to pitch down\\non the wheels as it is slowed down and flared for\\nlanding. Steering difficulties on the ground may\\noccur in nosewheel-type airplanes, particularly dur-\\ning the landing roll and takeoff.\\n• The CG position influences the lift and angle of\\nattack of the wing, the amount and direction of\\nforce on the tail, and the degree of deflection of\\nthe stabilizer needed to supply the proper tail\\nforce for equilibrium. The latter is very important\\nbecause of its relationship to elevator control\\nforce.\\n• The airplane will stall at a higher speed with a\\nforward CG location. This is because the stalling\\nangle of attack is reached at a higher speed due to\\nincreased wing loading.\\n• Higher elevator control forces normally exist\\nwith a forward CG location due to the increased\\nstabilizer deflection required to balance the air-\\nplane.\\n• The airplane will cruise faster with an aft CG\\nlocation because of reduced drag.

This is because when the CG is\\nmoved rearward it causes an increase in the angle\\nof attack.

SUBSONIC FLOW\\nIn subsonic aerodynamics, the theory of lift is based\\nupon the forces generated on a body and a moving\\ngas (air) in which it is immersed. At speeds below\\nabout 260 knots, air can be considered incompress-\\nible, in that at a fixed altitude, its density remains\\nnearly constant while its pressure varies. Under\\nthis assumption, air acts the same as water and is\\nclassified as a fluid. Subsonic aerodynamic theory\\nalso assumes the effects of viscosity (the property\\nof a fluid that tends to prevent motion of one part\\nof the fluid with respect to another) are negligible,\\nand classifies air as an ideal fluid, conforming to\\nthe principles of ideal-fluid aerodynamics such as\\ncontinuity, Bernoulli’s principle, and circulation.\\nIn reality, air is compressible and viscous. While the\\neffects of these properties are negligible at low\\nspeeds, compressibility effects in particular become\\nincreasingly important as speed increases.\\nCompressibility (and to a lesser extent viscosity) is\\nof paramount importance at speeds approaching the\\nspeed of sound. In these speed ranges, compressibil-\\nity causes a change in the density of the air around\\nan airplane.\\nDuring flight, a wing produces lift by accelerating\\nthe airflow over the upper surface. This accelerated\\nair can, and does, reach sonic speeds even though the\\nairplane itself may be flying subsonic. At some\\nextreme angles of attack, in some airplanes, the\\nspeed of the air over the top surface of the wing may\\nbe double the airplane’s speed. It is therefore entirely\\npossible to have both supersonic and subsonic air-\\nflow on an airplane at the same time. When flow\\nvelocities reach sonic speeds at some location on an\\nairplane (such as the area of maximum camber on\\nthe wing), further acceleration will result in the\\nonset of compressibility effects such as shock wave\\nformation, drag increase, buffeting, stability, and\\ncontrol difficulties. Subsonic flow principles are\\ninvalid at all speeds above this point. [Figure 3-40]\\nFigure 3-40. Wing airflow.\\nSPEED RANGES\\nThe speed of sound varies with temperature. Under\\nstandard temperature conditions of 15°C, the speed\\nof sound at sea level is 661 knots. At 40,000 feet,\\nwhere the temperature is –55°C, the speed of sound\\ndecreases to 574 knots. In high-speed flight and/or\\nhigh-altitude flight, the measurement of speed is\\nexpressed in terms of a “Mach number”—the ratio\\nof the true airspeed of the airplane to the speed of\\nsound in the same atmospheric conditions. An air-\\nplane traveling at the speed of sound is traveling at\\nMach 1.0. Airplane speed regimes are defined as\\nfollows:\\nSubsonic—Mach numbers below 0.75\\nTransonic—Mach numbers from .075 to 1.20\\nSupersonic—Mach numbers from 1.20 to 5.00\\nHypersonic—Mach numbers above 5.00\\nWhile flights in the transonic and supersonic ranges\\nare common occurrences for military airplanes,\\ncivilian jet airplanes normally operate in a cruise\\nspeed range of Mach 0.78 to Mach 0.90.\\nThe speed of an airplane in which airflow over any\\npart of the wing first reaches (but does not exceed)\\nMach 1.0 is termed that airplane’s critical Mach\\nnumber or “Mach Crit.” Thus, critical Mach number\\nM=.50\\nM=.72\\n(Critical Mach Number)\\nSupersonic\\nFlow\\nM=.77\\nNormal Shock Wave\\nSubsonic Possible Separation\\nMaximum Local Velocity\\nIs Less Than Sonic\\nMaximum Local Velocity\\nEqual To Sonic\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-35'),\n",

Shock waves, buffet, and airflow separation\\ntake place above critical Mach number. A jet airplane\\ntypically is most efficient when cruising at or near its\\ncritical Mach number. At speeds 5 – 10 percent above\\nthe critical Mach number, compressibility effects\\nbegin. Drag begins to rise sharply. Associated with\\nthe “drag rise” are buffet, trim and stability changes,\\nand a decrease in control surface effectiveness. This\\nis the point of “drag divergence,” and is typically the\\nspeed chosen for high-speed cruise operations. At\\nsome point beyond high-speed cruise are the turbine\\npowered airplane’s maximum operating limit\\nspeeds: V\\nMO/MMO. [Figure 3-41]\\nFigure 3-41. Critical Mach.\\nVMO is the maximum operating speed expressed in\\nterms of knots. V MO limits ram air pressure acting\\nagainst the structure and prevents flutter. M MO is the\\nmaximum operating speed expressed in terms of Mach\\nnumber. An airplane should not be flown in excess of\\nthis speed. Doing so risks encountering the full effects\\nof compressibility, including possible loss of control.\\nMACH NUMBER VS. AIRSPEED\\nSpeeds such as Mach Crit and M MO for a specific air-\\nplane occur at a given Mach number. The true airspeed\\n(TAS), however, varies with outside air temperature.\\nTherefore, true airspeeds corresponding to a specific\\nMach number can vary considerably (as much as 75 –\\n100 knots). When an airplane cruising at a constant\\nMach number enters an area of higher outside air tem-\\nperatures, true airspeed and required fuel increases, and\\nrange decreases. Conversely, when entering an area of\\ncolder outside air temperatures, true airspeed and fuel\\nflow decreases, and range increases.\\nIn a jet airplane operating at high altitude, the indicated\\nairspeed (IAS) for any given Mach number decreases\\nwith an increase in altitude above a certain level. The\\nreverse occurs during descent. Normally, climbs and\\ndescents are accomplished using indicated airspeed in\\nthe lower altitudes and Mach number in the higher\\naltitudes.\\nUnlike operations in the lower altitudes, the indi-\\ncated airspeed (IAS) at which a jet airplane stalls\\nincreases significantly with altitude. This is due to\\nthe fact that true airspeed (TAS) increases with\\naltitude. At high true airspeeds, air compression\\ncauses airflow distortion over the wings and in the\\npitot system. At the same time, the indicated airspeed\\n(IAS) representing M\\nMO decreases with altitude.\\nEventually, the airplane can reach an altitude where\\nthere is little or no difference between the two.\\nBOUNDARY LAYER\\nAir has viscosity, and will encounter resistance to\\nflow over a surface. The viscous nature of airflow\\nreduces the local velocities on a surface and is\\nresponsible for skin friction drag. As the air passes\\nover the wing’s surface, the air particles nearest the\\nsurface come to rest. The next layer of particles is\\nslowed down but not stopped. Some small but meas-\\nurable distance from the surface, the air particles are\\nmoving at free stream velocity. The layer of air over\\nthe wing’s surface, which is slowed down or stopped\\nby viscosity, is termed the “boundary layer.” Typical\\nboundary layer thicknesses on an airplane range\\nfrom small fractions of an inch near the leading edge\\nof a wing to the order of 12 inches at the aft end of a\\nlarge airplane such as a Boeing 747.\\nThere are two different types of boundary layer flow:\\nlaminar and turbulent. The laminar boundary layer is a\\nvery smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer\\ncontains swirls or “eddies.” The laminar flow creates\\nless skin friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is\\nless stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface\\nbegins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues\\nback from the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer\\nincreases in thickness. At some distance back from the\\nleading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down\\nand transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag\\nstandpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from\\nlaminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as\\npossible, or have a large amount of the wing surface\\nwithin the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The\\nlow energy laminar flow, however, tends to break\\ndown more suddenly than the turbulent layer.\\nAno\\nther phenomenon associated with viscous flow\\nis separation. Separation occurs when the airflow\\nbreaks away from an airfoil. The natural progression\\nis from laminar boundary layer to turbulent bound-\\nary layer and then to airflow separation. Airflow\\nseparation produces high drag and ultimately\\ndestroys lift.

[Figure 3-42]\\n“Vortex Generators” are used to delay or prevent\\nshock wave induced boundary layer separation\\nencountered in transonic flight. Vortex generators\\nare small low aspect ratio airfoils placed at a 12° to\\n15° angle of attack to the airstream. They are usu-\\nally spaced a few inches apart along the wing\\nahead of the ailerons or other control surfaces.\\nVortex generators create a vortex which mixes the\\nboundary airflow with the high energy airflow just\\nabove the surface. This produces higher surface\\nvelocities and increases the energy of the boundary\\nlayer. Thus, a stronger shock wave will be necessary\\nto produce airflow separation.\\nSHOCK WAVES\\nWhen an airplane flies at subsonic speeds, the air\\nahead is “warned” of the airplane’s coming by a\\npressure change transmitted ahead of the airplane at\\nthe speed of sound. Because of this warning, the air\\nbegins to move aside before the airplane arrives and\\nis prepared to let it pass easily. When the airplane’s\\nspeed reaches the speed of sound, the pressure\\nchange can no longer warn the air ahead because the\\nairplane is keeping up with its own pressure waves.\\nRather, the air particles pile up in front of the air-\\nplane causing a sharp decrease in the flow velocity\\ndirectly in front of the airplane with a corresponding\\nincrease in air pressure and density.\\nAs the airplane’s speed increases beyond the speed\\nof sound, the pressure and density of the compressed\\nair ahead of it increase, the area of compression\\nextending some distance ahead of the airplane. At\\nsome point in the airstream, the air particles are\\ncompletely undisturbed, having had no advanced\\nwarning of the airplane’s approach, and in the next\\ninstant the same air particles are forced to undergo\\nsudden and drastic changes in temperature, pressure,\\ndensity, and velocity. The boundary between the\\nundisturbed air and the region of compressed air is\\ncalled a shock or “compression” wave.\\nThis same type of wave is formed whenever a super-\\nsonic airstream is slowed to subsonic without a change\\nin direction, such as when the airstream is accelerated\\nto sonic speed over the cambered portion of a wing, and\\nthen decelerates to subsonic speed as the area of maxi-\\nmum camber is passed. A shock wave will form as a\\nboundary between the supersonic and subsonic ranges.\\nWhen\\never a shock wave forms perpendicular to the\\nairflow, it is termed a “normal” shock wave, and the\\nflow immediately behind the wave is subsonic. A\\nsupersonic airstream passing through a normal shock\\nwave will experience these changes:\\n• The airstream is slowed to subsonic.\\n• The airflow immediately behind the shock wave\\ndoes not change direction.\\n• The static pressure and density of the airstream\\nbehind the wave is greatly increased.\\n• The energy of the airstream (indicated by total\\npressure—dynamic plus static) is greatly\\nreduced.\\nShock wave formation causes an increase in drag. One\\nof the principal effects of a shock wave is the formation\\nof a dense high pressure region immediately behind the\\nwave. The instability of the high pressure region, and\\nthe fact that part of the velocity energy of the airstream\\nis converted to heat as it flows through the wave is a\\ncontributing factor in the drag increase, but the drag\\nresulting from airflow separation is much greater. If the\\nshock wave is strong, the boundary layer may not have\\nsufficient kinetic energy to withstand airflow separa-\\ntion. The drag incurred in the transonic region due to\\nshock wave formation and airflow separation is known\\nas “wave drag.” When speed exceeds the critical Mach\\nnumber by about 10 percent, wave drag increases\\nsharply. A considerable increase in thrust (power) is\\nrequired to increase flight speed beyond this point into\\nthe supersonic range where, depending on the airfoil\\nshape and the angle of attack, the boundary layer may\\nreattach.\\nNormal shock \\nwaves form on the wing’s upper\\nsurface first.

In other words, sweep will delay the onset of\\ncompressibility effects.\\nThe Mach number, which produces a sharp change in\\ndrag coefficient, is termed the “force divergence”\\nMach number and, for most airfoils, usually exceeds\\nthe critical Mach number by 5 to 10 percent. At this\\nspeed, the airflow separation induced by shock wave\\nformation can create significant variations in the drag,\\nlift, or pitching moment coefficients. In addition to\\nthe delay of the onset of compressibility effects,\\nsweepback reduces the magnitude in the changes of\\ndrag, lift or moment coefficients. In other words, the\\nuse of sweepback will “soften” the force divergence.\\nA disadvantage of swept wings is that they tend to\\nstall at the wingtips rather than at the wing roots.\\n[Figure 3-45] This is because the boundary layer tends\\nto flow spanwise toward the tips and to separate near\\nthe leading edges. Because the tips of a swept wing\\nare on the aft part of the wing (behind the center of\\nlift), a wingtip stall will cause the center of lift to\\nmove forward on the wing, forcing\\nthe nose to rise further. The tendency\\nfor tip stall is greatest when wing\\nsweep and taper are combined. \\nFigure 3-45 Wingtip stall.\\nThe stall situation can be aggravated by a T-tail config-\\nuration, which affords little or no pre-stall warning in\\nthe form of tail control surface buffet. [Figure 3-46]\\nThe T-tail, being above the wing wake remains\\neffective even after the wing has begun to stall,\\nallowing the pilot to inadvertently drive the wing\\ninto a deeper stall at a much greater angle of attack.\\nIf the horizontal tail surfaces then become buried in the\\nwing’s wake, the elevator may lose all effectiveness,\\nmaking it impossible to reduce pitch attitude and break\\nthe stall. In the pre-stall and immediate post-stall\\nregimes, the lift/drag qualities of a swept wing airplane\\n(specifically the enormous increase in drag at low\\nspeeds) can cause an increasingly descending flight-\\npath with no change in pitch attitude, further increasing\\nthe angle of attack. In this situation, without reliable\\nangle of attack information, a nose-down pitch attitude\\nwith an increasing airspeed is no guarantee that recovery\\nhas been effected, and up-elevator movement at this\\nstage may merely keep the airplane stalled.\\nIt is a characteristic of T-tail airplanes to pitch\\nup viciously when stalled in extreme nose-high\\nattitudes, making recovery difficult or violent. The\\nstick pusher inhibits this type of stall. At approxi-\\nmately one knot above stall speed, pre-programmed\\nstick forces automatically move the stick forward,\\npreventing the stall from developing. A “g” limiter\\nmay also be incorporated into the system to prevent\\nthe pitch down generated by the stick pusher from\\nimposing excessive loads on the airplane. A “stick\\nshaker,” on the other hand provides stall warning\\nwhen the airspeed is 5 to 7 percent above stall speed.\\nMACH BUFFET BOUNDARIES\\nThus far, only the Mach buffet that results from\\nexcessive speed has been addressed. It must be\\nremembered that Mach buffet is a function of the\\nspeed of the airflow over the wing—not necessarily\\nthe speed of the airplane.

This very high\\nangle of attack would have the effect of increasing\\nairflow velocity over the upper surface of the wing\\nto the point that all of the same effects of the shock\\nwaves and buffet would occur as in the high-speed\\nbuffet situation. The angle of attack of the wing\\nhas the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet\\nat either the high-speed or low-speed boundaries\\nfor the airplane. The conditions that increase the\\nangle of attack, hence the speed of the airflow over\\nthe wing and chances of Mach buffet are as follows:\\n• High Altitudes —The higher an airplane flies, the\\nthinner the air and the greater the angle of attack\\nrequired to produce the lift needed to maintain\\nlevel flight.\\n• Heavy Weights —The heavier the airplane, the\\ngreater the lift required of the wing, and all other\\nthings being equal, the greater the angle of attack.\\n• “G” Loading —An increase in the “G” loading\\non the airplane has the same effect as increasing\\nthe weight of the airplane. Whether the increase\\nin “G” forces is caused by turns, rough control\\nusage, or turbulence, the effect of increasing the\\nwing’s angle of attack is the same.\\nFLIGHT CONTROLS\\nOn high-speed airplanes, flight controls are divided\\ninto primary flight controls and secondary or auxil-\\niary flight controls. The primary flight controls\\nmaneuver the airplane about the pitch, roll, and yaw\\naxes. They include the ailerons, elevator, and rudder.\\nSecondary or auxiliary flight controls include tabs,\\nleading edge flaps, trailing edge flaps, spoilers, and\\nslats.\\nSpoilers are used on the upper surface of the wing to\\nspoil or reduce lift. High-speed airplanes, due to\\ntheir clean low drag design use spoilers as speed\\nbrakes to slow them down. Spoilers are extended\\nimmediately after touchdown to dump lift and thus\\ntransfer the weight of the airplane from the wings\\nonto the wheels for better braking performance.\\n[Figure 3-47]\\nJet transport airplanes have small ailerons. The space\\nfor ailerons is limited because as much of the wing\\ntrailing edge as possible is needed for flaps. Another\\nreason is that a conventional size aileron would cause\\nwing twist at high speed. Because the ailerons are nec-\\nessarily small, spoilers are used in unison with ailerons\\nto provide additional roll control.\\nSome jet transports have two sets of ailerons; a pair of\\noutboard low-speed ailerons, and a pair of high-speed\\ninboard ailerons. When the flaps are fully retracted\\nafter takeoff, the outboard ailerons are automatically\\nlocked out in the faired position.\\nWhen used for roll control, the spoiler on the side of\\nthe up-going aileron extends and reduces the lift on that\\nside, causing the wing to drop. If the spoilers are\\nextended as speed brakes, they can still be used for roll\\ncontrol. If they are the Differential type, they will\\nextend further on one side and retract on the other side.\\nIf they are the Non-Differential type, they will extend\\nfurther on one side but will not retract on the other side.\\nWhen fully extended as speed brakes, the Non-\\nDifferential spoilers remain extended and do not sup-\\nplement the ailerons.\\nTo obtain a smooth stall and a higher angle of attack\\nwithout airflow separation, an airplane’s wing leading\\nedge should have a well-rounded almost blunt shape\\nthat the airflow can adhere to at the higher angle of\\nattack. With this shape, the airflow separation will start\\nat the trailing edge and progress forward gradually as\\nangle of attack is increased.\\nThe pointed leadi\\nng edge necessary for high-speed\\nflight results in an abrupt stall and restricts the use\\nof trailing edge flaps because the airflow cannot\\nfollow the sharp curve around the wing leading\\nedge. The airflow tends to tear loose rather suddenly\\nfrom the upper surface at a moderate angle of attack.\\nTo utilize trailing edge flaps, and thus increase the\\nmaximum lift coefficient, the wing must go to a\\nhigher angle of attack without airflow separation.\\nTherefore, leading edge slots, slats, and flaps are\\nused to improve the low-speed characteristics during\\ntakeoff, climb, and landing. Although these devices\\nare not as powerful as trailing edge flaps, they are\\neffective when used full span in combination with\\nhigh-lift trailing edge flaps. With the aid of these\\nsophisticated high-lift devices, airflow separation is\\ndelayed and the maximum lift coefficient (C\\nLmax) is\\nincreased considerably. In fact, a 50-knot reduction\\nin stall speed is not uncommon.\\nThe operational requirements of a large jet transport\\nairplane necessitate large pitch trim changes. Some\\nof these requirements are:\\n• The requirement for a large CG range.\\n• The need to cover a large speed range.\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-40'),\n",

Large trim changes\\non a fixed-tail airplane require large elevator deflec-\\ntions. At these large deflections, little further elevator\\nmovement remains in the same direction. A variable\\nincidence horizontal stabilizer is designed to take out\\nthe trim changes. The stabilizer is larger than the\\nelevator, and consequently does not need to be\\nmoved through as large an angle. This leaves the\\nelevator streamlining the tail plane with a full range\\nof movement up and down. The variable incidence\\nhorizontal stabilizer can be set to handle the bulk of\\nthe pitch control demand, with the elevator handling\\nthe rest. On airplanes equipped with a variable\\nincidence horizontal stabilizer, the elevator is\\nsmaller and less effective in isolation than it is on\\na fixed-tail airplane. In comparison to other flight\\ncontrols, the variable incidence horizontal stabi-\\nlizer is enormously powerful in its effect.

The primary control systems consist of\\nthose that are required to safely control an airplane \\nduring flight. These include the ailerons, elevator (or\\nstabilator), and rudder. Secondary control systems\\nimprove the performance characteristics of the \\nairplane, or relieve the pilot of excessive control forces.\\nExamples of secondary control systems are wing flaps\\nand trim systems.\\nPRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROLS\\nAirplane control systems are carefully designed to \\nprovide a natural feel, and at the same time, allow \\nadequate responsiveness to control inputs. At low \\nairspeeds, the controls usually feel soft and sluggish,\\nand the airplane responds slowly to control applications.\\nAt high speeds, the controls feel firm and the response\\nis more rapid.\\nMovement of any of the three primary flight control\\nsurfaces changes the airflow and pressure distribution\\nover and around the airfoil.

For example, control-stop \\nmechanisms may be incorporated into the flight \\ncontrols, or movement of the control column and/or\\nrudder pedals may be limited. The purpose of these\\ndesign limits is to prevent the pilot from inadvertently \\novercontrolling and overstressing the aircraft during\\nnormal  maneuvers.\\nA properly designed airplane should be stable and \\neasily controlled during maneuvering.

Ailerons are connected by cables, \\nbellcranks, pulleys or push-pull tubes to each other \\nand to the control wheel.\\nMoving the control wheel to the right causes the right\\naileron to deflect upward and the left aileron to deflect\\ndownward. The upward deflection of the right aileron\\ndecreases the camber resulting in decreased lift on the\\nright wing. The corresponding downward deflection of\\nthe left aileron increases the camber resulting in\\nincreased lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift\\non the left wing and the decreased lift on the right wing\\ncauses the airplane to roll to the right.\\nADVERSE YAW\\nSince the downward deflected aileron produces more\\nlift, it also produces more drag. This added drag\\nattempts to yaw the airplane’s nose in the direction of\\nthe raised wing. This is called adverse yaw. [Figure 4-2]\\nThe rudder is used to counteract adverse yaw, and the\\namount of rudder control required is greatest at low \\nairspeeds, high angles of attack, and with large aileron\\ndeflections. However, with lower airspeeds, the vertical\\nstabilizer/rudder combination becomes less effective,\\nand magnifies the control problems associated with\\nadverse yaw. \\nAll turns are coordinated by use of ailerons, rudder, and\\nelevator. Applying aileron pressure is necessary to\\nplace the airplane in the desired angle of bank, while\\nsimultaneously applying rudder pressure to counteract\\nthe resultant adverse yaw. During a turn, the angle of\\nattack must be increased by applying elevator pressure\\nbecause more lift is required than when in straight-and-\\nlevel flight. The steeper the turn, the more back \\nelevator pressure is needed. \\nAs the desired angle of bank is established, aileron and\\nrudder pressures should be relaxed. This will stop the\\nbank from increasing because the aileron and rudder\\ncontrol surfaces will be neutral in their streamlined\\nposition. Elevator pressure should be held constant to\\nmaintain a constant altitude. \\nThe rollout from a turn is similar to the roll-in except\\nthe flight controls are applied in the opposite direction.\\nAileron and rudder are applied in the direction of the\\nrollout or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank\\ndecreases, the elevator pressure should be relaxed as\\nnecessary to maintain altitude.\\nDIFFERENTIAL AILERONS\\nWith differential ailerons, one aileron is raised a greater\\ndistance than the other aileron is lowered for a given\\nmovement of the control wheel. This produces an\\nincrease in drag on the descending wing. The \\ngreater drag results from deflecting the up aileron on \\nthe descending wing to a greater angle than the down\\naileron on the rising wing. While adverse yaw is\\nreduced, it is not eliminated completely. [Figure 4-3]\\nFRISE-TYPE AILERONS\\nWith a Frise-type aileron, when pressure is applied to\\nthe control wheel, the aileron that is being raised pivots\\non an offset hinge. This projects the leading edge of the\\naileron into the airflow and creates drag. This helps\\nequalize the drag created by the lowered aileron on the\\nopposite wing and reduces adverse yaw.

Frise-type ailerons\\nalso may be designed to function differentially. Like\\nthe differential aileron, the Frise-type aileron does not\\neliminate adverse yaw entirely. Coordinated rudder\\napplication is still needed wherever ailerons are\\napplied.\\nCOUPLED AILERONS AND RUDDER\\nCoupled ailerons and rudder means these controls are\\nlinked. This is accomplished with rudder-aileron \\ninterconnect springs, which help correct for aileron\\ndrag by automatically deflecting the rudder at the same\\ntime the ailerons are deflected. For example, when the\\ncontrol yoke is moved to produce a left roll, the \\ninterconnect cable and spring pulls forward on the left\\nrudder pedal just enough to prevent the nose of the \\nairplane from yawing to the right. The force applied to\\nthe rudder by the springs can be overridden if it\\nbecomes necessary to slip the airplane. [Figure 4-5]\\nELEVATOR\\nThe elevator controls pitch about the lateral axis. Like\\nthe ailerons on small airplanes, the elevator is \\nconnected to the control column in the cockpit by a\\nseries of mechanical linkages. Aft movement of the\\ncontrol column deflects the trailing edge of the elevator\\nsurface up. This is usually referred to as up elevator.\\n[Figure 4-6]\\nThe up-elevator position decreases the camber of the\\nelevator and creates a downward aerodynamic force,\\nwhich is greater than the normal tail-down force that\\nexists in straight-and-level flight. The overall effect\\ncauses the tail of the airplane to move down and the\\nnose to pitch up. The pitching moment occurs about the\\ncenter of gravity (CG). The strength of the pitching\\nmoment is determined by the distance between the CG\\nand the horizontal tail surface, as well as by the \\naerodynamic effectiveness of the horizontal tail surface.\\nMoving the control column forward has the opposite\\neffect. In this case, elevator camber increases, creating\\nmore lift (less tail-down force) on the horizontal \\nstabilizer/elevator. This moves the tail upward and\\npitches the nose down. Again, the pitching moment\\noccurs about the CG.\\nAs mentioned earlier in the coverage on stability,\\npower, thrustline, and the position of the horizontal tail\\nsurfaces on the empennage are factors in how effective\\nthe elevator is in controlling pitch. For example, the\\nhorizontal tail surfaces may be attached near the lower\\npart of the vertical stabilizer, at the midpoint, or at the\\nhigh point, as in the T-tail design. \\nT-TAIL\\nIn a T-tail configuration, the elevator is above most of\\nthe effects of downwash from the propeller as well as\\nairflow around the fuselage and/or wings during \\nnormal flight conditions. Operation of the elevators in\\nthis undisturbed air makes for control movements that\\nare consistent throughout most flight regimes. T-tail\\ndesigns have become popular on many light airplanes\\nand on large aircraft, especially those with aft-fuselage\\nmounted engines since the T-tail configuration removes\\nthe tail from the exhaust blast of the engines. Seaplanes\\nand amphibians often have T-tails in order to keep the\\nhorizontal surfaces as far from the water as possible.\\nAn additional benefit is reduced vibration and noise\\ninside the aircraft.\\nAt slow speeds, the elevator on a T-tail aircraft must be\\nmoved through a larger number of degrees of travel \\nto raise the nose a given amount as compared \\nto a conventional-tail aircraft.

Since controls on aircraft are rigged in such a\\nmanner as to require increasing control forces for\\nincreased control travel, the forces required to raise the\\nnose of a T-tail aircraft are greater than for a \\nconventional-tail aircraft. Longitudinal stability of a\\ntrimmed aircraft is the same for both types of \\nconfiguration, but the pilot must be aware that at slow\\nspeeds during takeoffs and landings or stalls, the \\ncontrol forces will be greater than for similar size \\nairplanes equipped with conventional tails. \\nT-tail airplanes also require additional design\\nconsiderations to counter the problem of flutter. Since\\nthe weight of the horizontal surfaces is at the top of the\\nvertical stabilizer, the moment arm created causes high\\nloads on the vertical stabilizer which can result in\\nflutter. Engineers must compensate for this by \\nincreasing the design stiffness of the vertical stabilizer,\\nusually resulting in a weight penalty over conventional\\ntail designs.\\nWhen flying at a very high angle of attack with a low\\nairspeed and an aft CG, the T-tail airplane may be \\nsusceptible to a deep stall. In a deep stall, the airflow\\nover the horizontal tail is blanketed by the disturbed\\nairflow from the wings and fuselage. In these \\ncircumstances, elevator or stabilator control could be\\ndiminished, making it difficult to recover from the \\nstall. It should be noted that an aft CG could \\nbe a contributing factor in these incidents since \\nsimilar recovery problems are also found with \\nconventional-tail aircraft with an aft CG. [Figure 4-7]\\nSince flight at a high angle of attack with a low \\nairspeed and an aft CG position can be dangerous,\\nmany airplanes have systems to compensate for this \\nsituation. The systems range from control stops to \\nelevator down springs. An elevator down spring assists\\nin lowering the nose to prevent a stall caused by the aft\\nCG position. The stall occurs because the properly\\ntrimmed airplane is flying with the elevator in a trailing\\nedge down position, forcing the tail up and the nose\\ndown. In this unstable condition, if the airplane\\nencounters turbulence and slows down further, the trim\\ntab no longer positions the elevator in the nose-down\\nposition. The elevator then streamlines, and the nose of\\nthe aircraft pitches upward. This aggravates the \\nsituation and can possibly result in a stall. \\nThe elevator down spring produces a mechanical load\\non the elevator, causing it to move toward the nose-\\ndown position if not otherwise balanced. The elevator\\ntrim tab balances the elevator down spring to position\\nthe elevator in a trimmed position. When the trim tab\\nbecomes ineffective, the down spring drives the \\nelevator to a nose down position. The nose of \\nthe aircraft lowers, speed builds up, and a stall is \\nprevented. [Figure 4-8]\\nThe elevator must also have sufficient authority to hold\\nthe nose of the airplane up during the roundout for a\\nlanding. In this case, a forward CG may cause a \\nproblem. During the landing flare, power normally is\\nreduced, which decreases the airflow over the \\nempennage. This, coupled with the reduced landing\\nspeed, makes the elevator less effective.\\nFrom this discussion, it should be apparent that pilots\\nmust understand and follow proper loading procedures,\\nparticularly with regard to the CG position. More \\ninformation on aircraft loading, as well as weight and\\nbalance, is included in Chapter 8.\\nSTABILATOR\\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, a stabilator is essentially a\\none-piece horizontal stabilizer with the same type of\\ncontrol system. Because stabilators pivot around a \\ncentral hinge point, they are extremely sensitive to \\ncontrol inputs and aerodynamic loads.\\nAntiservo tabs are incorporated on the trailing edge to\\ndecrease sensitivity. In addition, a balance weight is\\nusually incorporated ahead of the main spar. The\\nbalance weight may project into the empennage or may\\nbe incorporated on the forward portion of the\\nstabilator tips.

Pushing the control column forward lowers the\\ntrailing edge of the stabilator and pitches the nose of\\nthe airplane down. Without an antiservo tab, the \\nairplane would be prone to overcontrolling from\\npilot-induced control inputs.\\nCANARD\\nThe term canard refers to a control surface that \\nfunctions as a horizontal stabilizer but is located in\\nfront of the main wings. The term also is used to\\ndescribe an airplane equipped with a canard. In effect,\\nit is an airfoil similar to the horizontal surface on \\na conventional aft-tail design. The difference is that the\\ncanard actually creates lift and holds the nose up, as\\nopposed to the aft-tail design which exerts downward\\nforce on the tail to prevent the nose from rotating \\ndownward. [Figure 4-10]\\nAlthough the Wright Flyer was configured as a \\ncanard with the horizontal surfaces in front of the \\nlifting surface, it was not until recently that the\\ncanard configuration began appearing on newer \\nairplanes. Canard designs include two types—one with\\na horizontal surface of about the same size as a normal\\naft-tail design, and the other with a surface of the same\\napproximate size and airfoil of the aft-mounted wing\\nknown as a tandem wing configuration. Theoretically,\\nthe canard is considered more efficient because using\\nthe horizontal surface to help lift the weight of the \\naircraft should result in less drag for a given \\namount of lift. \\nThe canard’s main advantage is in the area of stall \\ncharacteristics. A properly designed canard or tandem\\nwing will run out of authority to raise the nose of the\\naircraft at a point before the main wing will stall. This\\nmakes the aircraft stall-proof and results only in a\\ndescent rate that can be halted by adding power.\\nAilerons on the main wing remain effective throughout\\nthe recovery. Other canard configurations are designed\\nso the canard stalls before the main wing, automatically\\nlowering the nose and recovering the aircraft to a safe\\nflying speed. Again, the ailerons remain effective\\nthroughout the stall. \\nThe canard design has several limitations. First, it is\\nimportant that the forward lifting surface of a canard\\ndesign stalls before the main wing. If the main wing\\nstalls first, the lift remaining from the forward wing or\\ncanard would be well ahead of the CG, and the airplane\\nwould pitch up uncontrollably. Second, when the for-\\nward surface stalls first, or is limited in its ability to\\nincrease the angle of attack, the main wing never\\nreaches a point where its maximum lift is created, \\nsacrificing some performance. Third, use of flaps on\\nthe main wing causes design problems for the forward\\nwing or canard. As lift on the main wing is increased\\nby extension of flaps, the lift requirement of the canard\\nis also increased. The forward wing or canard must be\\nlarge enough to accommodate flap use, but not so large\\nthat it creates more lift than the main wing.\\nFinally, the relationship of the main wing to the \\nforward surface also makes a difference. When \\npositioned closely in the vertical plane, downwash\\nfrom the forward wing can have a negative effect on\\nthe lift of the main wing. Increasing vertical separation\\nincreases efficiency of the design. Efficiency is also\\nincreased as the size of the two surfaces grows closer to\\nbeing equal.\\nRUDDER\\nThe rudder controls movement of the airplane about its\\nvertical axis.

These surfaces, which are\\nattached to the trailing edge of the wing, increase both\\nlift and induced drag for any given angle of attack.\\nFlaps allow a compromise between high cruising speed\\nand low landing speed, because they may be extended\\nwhen needed, and retracted into the wing’s structure\\nwhen not needed. There are four common types\\nof flaps: plain, split, slotted, and Fowler flaps.\\n[Figure 4-13]\\nThe plain flap is the simplest of the four types. It\\nincreases the airfoil camber, resulting in a significant\\nincrease in the coefficient of lift at a given angle of\\nattack. At the same time, it greatly increases drag and\\nmoves the center of pressure aft on the airfoil, resulting\\nin a nose-down pitching moment.\\nRuddervator—A pair of control surfaces on the tail of an aircraft\\narranged in the form of a V .

However, more drag is created\\nbecause of the turbulent air pattern produced behind\\nthe airfoil. When fully extended, both plain and split\\nflaps produce high drag with little additional lift. \\nThe most popular flap on airplanes today is the slotted\\nflap. Variations of this design are used for small \\nairplanes as well as for large ones. Slotted flaps\\nincrease the lift coefficient significantly more than\\nplain or spilt flaps. On small airplanes, the hinge is\\nlocated below the lower surface of the flap, and when\\nthe flap is lowered, it forms a duct between the flap\\nwell in the wing and the leading edge of the flap.\\nWhen the slotted flap is lowered, high-energy air from\\nthe lower surface is ducted to the flap’s upper surface.\\nThe high-energy air from the slot accelerates the upper\\nsurface boundary layer and delays airflow separation,\\nproviding a higher coefficient of lift. Thus, the slotted\\nflap produces much greater increases in C\\nLmax than the\\nplain or split flap. While there are many types of \\nslotted flaps, large airplanes often have double- and even\\ntriple-slotted flaps. These allow the maximum increase in\\ndrag without the airflow over the flaps separating and\\ndestroying the lift they produce. \\nFowler flaps are a type of slotted flap. This flap design\\nnot only changes the camber of the wing, it also\\nincreases the wing area. Instead of rotating down on a\\nhinge, it slides backwards on tracks. In the first portion\\nof its extension, it increases the drag very little, but\\nincreases the lift a great deal as it increases both the\\narea and camber. As the extension continues, the flap\\ndeflects downward, and during the last portion of its\\ntravel, it increases the drag with little additional\\nincrease in lift.\\nLEADING EDGE DEVICES\\nHigh-lift devices also can be applied to the leading edge\\nof the airfoil. The most common types are fixed slots,\\nmovable slats, and leading edge flaps. [Figure 4-14]\\nFixed slots direct airflow to the upper wing surface and\\ndelay airflow separation at higher angles of attack. The\\nslot does not increase the wing camber, but allows a\\nhigher maximum coefficient of lift because the stall is\\ndelayed until the wing reaches a greater angle of attack. \\nMovable slats consist of leading edge segments, which\\nmove on tracks. At low angles of attack, each slat \\nis held flush against the wing’s leading edge by the high\\npressure that forms at the wing’s leading edge. As the\\nangle of attack increases, the high-pressure area moves\\naft below the lower surface of the wing, allowing \\nthe slats to move forward. Some slats, however, are\\npilot operated and can be deployed at any angle of\\nattack. Opening a slat allows the air below the wing\\nto flow over the wing’s upper surface, delaying \\nairflow separation. \\nLeading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, are used to\\nincrease both C\\nLmax and the camber of the wings. This\\ntype of leading edge device is frequently used in \\nconjunction with trailing edge flaps and can reduce the\\nnose-down pitching movement produced by the latter.\\nAs is true with trailing edge flaps, a small increment of\\nleading edge flaps increases lift to a much greater\\nextent than drag. As greater amounts of flaps are\\nextended, drag increases at a greater rate than lift. \\nSPOILERS\\nOn some airplanes, high-drag devices called spoilers\\nare deployed from the wings to spoil the smooth \\nairflow, reducing lift and increasing drag. Spoilers are\\nused for roll control on some aircraft, one of the\\nadvantages being the elimination of adverse yaw. To\\nturn right, for example, the spoiler on the right wing is\\nraised, destroying some of the lift and creating more\\ndrag on the right. The right wing drops, and the airplane\\nbanks and yaws to the right. Deploying spoilers on both\\nwings at the same time allows the aircraft to descend\\nwithout gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed to\\nhelp shorten ground roll after landing. By destroying\\nlift, they transfer weight to the wheels, improving \\nbraking effectiveness.

Trim systems usually consist of cockpit \\ncontrols and small hinged devices attached to the \\ntrailing edge of one or more of the primary flight \\ncontrol surfaces. They are designed to help minimize \\na pilot’s workload by aerodynamically assisting \\nmovement and position of the flight control surface to\\nwhich they are attached. Common types of trim \\nsystems include trim tabs, balance tabs, antiservo \\ntabs, ground adjustable tabs, and an adjustable \\nstabilizer.\\nTRIM TABS\\nThe most common installation on small airplanes is a\\nsingle trim tab attached to the trailing edge of the \\nelevator. Most trim tabs are manually operated by a\\nsmall, vertically mounted control wheel. However, \\na trim crank may be found in some airplanes. The \\ncockpit control includes a tab position indicator.\\nPlacing the trim control in the full nose-down \\nposition moves the tab to its full up position. With the\\ntab up and into the airstream, the airflow over the \\nhorizontal tail surface tends to force the trailing edge of\\nthe elevator down. This causes the tail of the airplane\\nto move up, and results in a nose-down pitch change.\\n[Figure 4-16]\\nIf you set the trim tab to the full nose-up position, the\\ntab moves to its full-down position. In this case, the air\\nflowing under the horizontal tail surface hits the tab\\nand tends to force the trailing edge of the elevator up,\\nreducing the elevator’s angle of attack. This causes a\\ntail-down movement of the airplane and a nose-up\\npitch change.\\nIn spite of the opposite direction movement of the trim\\ntab and the elevator, control of trim is natural to a pilot.\\nIf you have to exert constant back pressure on the \\ncontrol column, the need for nose-up trim is indicated.\\nThe normal trim procedure is to continue trimming\\nuntil the airplane is balanced and the nose-heavy \\ncondition is no longer apparent. Pilots normally \\nestablish the desired power, pitch attitude, and\\nconfiguration first, and then trim the airplane to relieve\\ncontrol pressures that may exist for that flight \\ncondition. Any time power, pitch attitude, or\\nconfiguration is changed, expect that retrimming will\\nbe necessary to relieve the control pressures for the\\nnew flight condition.\\nBALANCE TABS\\nThe control forces may be excessively high in \\nsome airplanes, and in order to decrease them, the \\nmanufacturer may use balance tabs. They look like trim\\ntabs and are hinged in approximately the same places\\nas trim tabs. The essential difference between the two\\nis that the balancing tab is coupled to the control \\nsurface rod so that when the primary control surface is\\nmoved in any direction, the tab automatically moves in\\nthe opposite direction. In this manner, the airflow \\nstriking the tab counter-balances some of the air \\npressure against the primary control surface, and\\nenables the pilot to more easily move and hold the \\ncontrol surface in position.\\nIf the linkage between the tab and the fixed surface is\\nadjustable from the cockpit, the tab acts as a \\ncombination trim and balance tab, which can be\\nadjusted to any desired deflection. Any time the control\\nsurface is deflected, the tab moves in the opposite\\ndirection and eases the load on the pilot. \\nANTISERVO TABS\\nIn addition to decreasing the sensitivity of the \\nstabilator, an antiservo tab also functions as a trim\\ndevice to relieve control pressure and maintain the \\nstabilator in the desired position. The fixed end of \\nthe linkage is on the opposite side of the surface \\nfrom the horn on the tab, and when the trailing edge of\\nthe stabilator moves up, the linkage forces the trailing\\nedge of the tab up. When the stabilator moves down,\\nthe tab also moves down. This is different than trim\\ntabs on elevators, which move opposite of the control \\nsurface.

For example, when the trailing edge\\nof the stabilator moves up, the linkage forces the \\ntrailing edge of the tab up. When the stabilator moves\\ndown, the tab also moves down. \\nGROUND ADJUSTABLE TABS\\nMany small airplanes have a non-moveable metal trim\\ntab on the rudder. This tab is bent in one direction or\\nthe other while on the ground to apply a trim force to\\nthe rudder. The correct displacement is determined by\\ntrial-and-error process. Usually, small adjustments are\\nnecessary until you are satisfied that the airplane is no\\nlonger skidding left or right during normal cruising\\nflight. [Figure 4-18]\\nADJUSTABLE STABILIZER\\nRather than using a movable tab on the trailing edge of\\nthe elevator, some airplanes have an adjustable \\nstabilizer. With this arrangement, linkages pivot \\nthe horizontal stabilizer about its rear spar. This is\\naccomplished by use of a jackscrew mounted on the\\nleading edge of the stabilator. [Figure 4-19]\\nOn small airplanes, the jackscrew is cable-operated\\nwith a trim wheel or crank, and on larger airplanes, \\nit is motor driven.

The name is derived from the back-and-forth,\\nor reciprocating, movement of the pistons. It is this\\nmotion that produces the mechanical energy needed to\\naccomplish work. Two common means of classifying\\nreciprocating engines are:\\n1. by cylinder arrangement with respect to the\\ncrankshaft—radial, in-line, v-type or opposed, or\\n2. by the method of cooling—liquid or air-cooled.\\nRadial engines were widely used during World War II,\\nand many are still in service today. With these engines,\\na row or rows of cylinders are arranged in a circular\\npattern around the crankcase. The main advantage of a\\nradial engine is the favorable power-to-weight ratio.\\nIn-line engines have a comparatively small frontal area,\\nbut their power-to-weight ratios are relatively low. In\\naddition, the rearmost cylinders of an air-cooled,\\nin-line engine receive very little cooling air, so these\\nengines are normally limited to four or six cylinders.\\nV-type engines provide more horsepower than in-line\\nengines and still retain a small frontal area. Further\\nimprovements in engine design led to the development\\nof the horizontally-opposed engine.\\nOpposed-type engines are the most popular reciprocat-\\ning engines used on small airplanes. These engines\\nalways have an even number of cylinders, since a\\ncylinder on one side of the crankcase “opposes” a\\ncylinder on the other side. The majority of these\\nengines are air cooled and usually are mounted in a\\nhorizontal position when installed on fixed-wing\\nairplanes. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-\\nweight ratios because they have a comparatively small,\\nlightweight crankcase. In addition, the compact\\ncylinder arrangement reduces the engine’s frontal area\\nand allows a streamlined installation that minimizes\\naerodynamic drag.\\nPowerplant—A complete engine and propeller combination\\nwith accessories.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-1'),\n",

The\\nintake/exhaust valves, spark plugs, and pistons are\\nlocated in the cylinders. The crankshaft and connecting\\nrods are located in the crankcase. [Figure 5-1] The\\nmagnetos are normally located on the engine accessory\\nhousing.\\nThe basic principle for reciprocating engines involves\\nthe conversion of chemical energy, in the form of fuel,\\ninto mechanical energy. This occurs within the\\ncylinders of the engine through a process known as the\\nfour-stroke operating cycle. These strokes are called\\nintake, compression, power, and exhaust. [Figure 5-2]\\n1. The intake stroke begins as the piston starts its\\ndownward travel. When this happens, the intake\\nvalve opens and the fuel/air mixture is drawn into\\nthe cylinder.\\n2. The compression stroke begins when the intake\\nvalve closes and the piston starts moving back to\\nthe top of the cylinder. This phase of the cycle is\\nused to obtain a much greater power output from\\nthe fuel/air mixture once it is ignited.\\n3. The power stroke begins when the fuel/air\\nmixture is ignited. This causes a tremendous\\npressure increase in the cylinder, and forces the\\npiston downward away from the cylinder head,\\ncreating the power that turns the crankshaft.\\n4. The exhaust stroke is used to purge the cylinder\\nof burned gases. It begins when the exhaust valve\\nopens and the piston starts to move toward the\\ncylinder head once again.\\nEven when the engine is operated at a fairly low speed,\\nthe four-stroke cycle takes place several hundred times\\neach minute.

The amount of thrust\\nproduced depends on the shape of the airfoil, the angle\\nof attack of the propeller blade, and the r.p.m. of the\\nengine. The propeller itself is twisted so the blade angle\\nchanges from hub to tip. The greatest angle of\\nincidence, or the highest pitch, is at the hub while the\\nsmallest pitch is at the tip. [Figure 5-3]\\nThe reason for the twist is to produce uniform lift from\\nthe hub to the tip. As the blade rotates, there is a\\ndifference in the actual speed of the various portions of\\nthe blade. The tip of the blade travels faster than that\\npart near the hub, because the tip travels a greater\\ndistance than the hub in the same length of time.\\nChanging the angle of incidence (pitch) from the hub\\nto the tip to correspond with the speed produces\\nuniform lift throughout the length of the blade. If the\\npropeller blade was designed with the same angle of\\nincidence throughout its entire length, it would be\\ninefficient, because as airspeed increases in flight, the\\nportion near the hub would have a negative angle of\\nattack while the blade tip would be stalled.

With this type of propeller, the\\nbest efficiency is achieved only at a given combination\\nof airspeed and r.p.m.\\nThere are two types of fixed-pitch propellers—the\\nclimb propeller and the cruise propeller. Whether the\\nairplane has a climb or cruise propeller installed\\ndepends upon its intended use:\\n• The climb propeller has a lower pitch, therefore\\nless drag. Less drag results in higher r.p.m. and\\nmore horsepower capability, which increases\\nperformance during takeoffs and climbs, but\\ndecreases performance during cruising flight.\\n• The cruise propeller has a higher pitch, therefore\\nmore drag. More drag results in lower r.p.m. and\\nless horsepower capability, which decreases\\nperformance during takeoffs and climbs, but\\nincreases efficiency during cruising flight.\\nThe propeller is usually mounted on a shaft, which may\\nbe an extension of the engine crankshaft. In this case,\\nthe r.p.m. of the propeller would be the same as the\\ncrankshaft r.p.m. On some engines, the propeller is\\nmounted on a shaft geared to the engine crankshaft. In\\nthis type, the r.p.m. of the propeller is different than\\nthat of the engine. In a fixed-pitch propeller, the\\ntachometer is the indicator of engine power.\\n[Figure 5-5]\\nA tachometer is calibrated in hundreds of r.p.m., and\\ngives a direct indication of the engine and propeller\\nr.p.m. The instrument is color-coded, with a green arc\\ndenoting the maximum continuous operating r.p.m.\\nSome tachometers have additional markings to reflect\\nAngle of Incidence—For a propeller, it is the angle formed by the chord\\nline and the reference plane containing the propeller hub.

Therefore, the\\nmanufacturer’s recommendations should be used as a\\nreference to clarify any misunderstanding of\\ntachometer markings.\\nThe revolutions per minute are regulated by the\\nthrottle, which controls the fuel/air flow to the engine.\\nAt a given altitude, the higher the tachometer reading,\\nthe higher the power output of the engine.\\nWhen operating altitude increases, the tachometer may\\nnot show correct power output of the engine. For\\nexample, 2,300 r.p.m. at 5,000 feet produce less\\nhorsepower than 2,300 r.p.m. at sea level. The reason\\nfor this is that power output depends on air density. Air\\ndensity decreases as altitude increases. Therefore, a\\ndecrease in air density (higher density altitude)\\ndecreases the power output of the engine. As altitude\\nchanges, the position of the throttle must be changed to\\nmaintain the same r.p.m. As altitude is increased, the\\nthrottle must be opened further to indicate the same\\nr.p.m. as at a lower altitude.\\nADJUSTABLE-PITCH PROPELLER\\nAlthough some older adjustable-pitch propellers could\\nonly be adjusted on the ground, most modern\\nadjustable-pitch propellers are designed so that you can\\nchange the propeller pitch in flight. The first\\nadjustable-pitch propeller systems provided only two\\npitch settings \\uf8e7a low-pitch setting and a high-pitch\\nsetting. Today, however, nearly all adjustable-pitch\\npropeller systems are capable of a range of\\npitch settings.\\nA constant-speed propeller is the most common type of\\nadjustable-pitch propeller. The main advantage of a\\nconstant-speed propeller is that it converts a high\\npercentage of brake horsepower (BHP) into thrust\\nhorsepower (THP) over a wide range of r.p.m. and\\nairspeed combinations. A constant-speed propeller is\\nmore efficient than other propellers because it allows\\nselection of the most efficient engine r.p.m. for the\\ngiven conditions.\\nAn airplane with a constant-speed propeller has two\\ncontrols—the throttle and the propeller control. The\\nthrottle controls power output, and the propeller\\ncontrol regulates engine r.p.m. and, in turn, propeller\\nr.p.m., which is registered on the tachometer.\\nOnce a specific r.p.m. is selected, a governor\\nautomatically adjusts the propeller blade angle as\\nnecessary to maintain the selected r.p.m. For example,\\nafter setting the desired r.p.m. during cruising flight, an\\nincrease in airspeed or decrease in propeller load will\\ncause the propeller blade angle to increase as necessary\\nto maintain the selected r.p.m. A reduction in airspeed\\nor increase in propeller load will cause the propeller\\nblade angle to decrease.\\nThe range of possible blade angles for a constant-speed\\npropeller is the propeller’s constant-speed range and is\\ndefined by the high and low pitch stops. As long as the\\npropeller blade angle is within the constant-speed range\\nand not against either pitch stop, a constant engine\\nr.p.m. will be maintained. However, once the propeller\\nblades contact a pitch stop, the engine r.p.m. will\\nincrease or decrease as appropriate, with changes in\\nairspeed and propeller load. For example, once a\\nspecific r.p.m. has been selected, if aircraft speed\\ndecreases enough to rotate the propeller blades until\\nthey contact the low pitch stop, any further decrease in\\nairspeed will cause engine r.p.m. to decrease the same\\nway as if a fixed-pitch propeller were installed. The\\nsame holds true when an airplane equipped with a\\nconstant-speed propeller accelerates to a faster\\nairspeed. As the aircraft accelerates, the propeller blade\\nangle increases to maintain the selected r.p.m. until the\\nhigh pitch stop is reached. Once this occurs, the blade\\nangle cannot increase any further and engine\\nr.p.m. increases.\\nOn airplanes that are equipped with a constant-speed\\npropeller, power output is controlled by the throttle and\\nindicated by a manifold pressure gauge. The gauge\\nmeasures the absolute pressure of the fuel/air mixture\\ninside the intake manifold and is more correctly a\\nmeasure of manifold absolute pressure (MAP) . At a\\nconstant r.p.m. and altitude, the amount of power\\nproduced is directly related to the fuel/air flow being\\ndelivered to the combustion chamber. As you increase\\nthe throttle setting, more fuel and air is flowing to the\\nengine; therefore, MAP increases. When the engine is\\nnot running, the manifold pressure gauge indicates\\nambient air pressure (i.e., 29.92 in. Hg). When the\\nengine is started, the manifold pressure indication will\\ndecrease to a value less than ambient pressure (i.e., idle\\nat 12 in. Hg). Correspondingly, engine failure or power\\nloss is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase\\nin manifold pressure to a value corresponding to the\\nambient air pressure at the altitude where the failure\\noccurred. [Figure 5-6]\\nThe manifold pressure gauge is color-coded to indicate\\nthe engine’s operating range. The face of the manifold\\npressure gauge contains a green arc to show the normal\\noperating range, and a red radial line to indicate the\\nupper limit of manifold pressure.\\nFor any given r.p.m., there is a manifold pressure that\\nshould not be exceeded. If manifold pressure is\\nexcessive for a given r.p.m., the pressure within the\\ncylinders could be exceeded, thus placing undue stress\\non the cylinders. If repeated too frequently, this stress\\ncould weaken the cylinder components, and eventually\\ncause engine failure.\\nManifold Absolute Pressure (MAP)—The absolute pressure of the\\nfuel/air mixture within the intake manifold, usually indicated in inches\\nof mercury.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-4'),\n",

Outside air\\nenters the induction system through an intake port on\\nthe front of the engine cowling. This port normally con-\\ntains an air filter that inhibits the entry of dust and other\\nforeign objects. Since the filter may occasionally\\nbecome clogged, an alternate source of air must be\\navailable. Usually, the alternate air comes from inside\\nthe engine cowling, where it bypasses a clogged\\nair filter. Some alternate air sources function\\nautomatically, while others operate manually.\\nTwo types of induction systems are commonly used in\\nsmall airplane engines:\\n1. the carburetor system, which mixes the fuel and\\nair in the carburetor before this mixture enters the\\nintake manifold, and\\n2. the fuel injection system, which mixes the fuel\\nand air just before entry into each cylinder.\\nCARBURETOR SYSTEMS\\nCarburetors are classified as either float-type or\\npressure-type. Pressure carburetors are usually not\\nfound on small airplanes. The basic difference between\\na pressure carburetor and a float-type is the pressure\\ncarburetor delivers fuel under pressure by a fuel pump.\\nIn the operation of the float-type carburetor system, the\\noutside air first flows through an air filter, usually\\nlocated at an air intake in the front part of the engine\\ncowling. This filtered air flows into the carburetor and\\nthrough a venturi, a narrow throat in the carburetor.\\nWhen the air flows through the venturi, a low-pressure\\narea is created, which forces the fuel to flow through a\\nmain fuel jet located at the throat. The fuel then flows\\ninto the airstream, where it is mixed with the flowing\\nair. See figure 5-7 on page 5-6.\\nThe fuel/air mixture is then drawn through the intake\\nmanifold and into the combustion chambers, where it is\\nignited. The “float-type carburetor” acquires its name\\nfrom a float, which rests on fuel within the float\\nchamber. A needle attached to the float opens and\\ncloses an opening at the bottom of the carburetor bowl.\\nThis meters the correct amount of fuel into the\\ncarburetor, depending upon the position of the float,\\nwhich is controlled by the level of fuel in the float\\nchamber. When the level of the fuel forces the float to\\nrise, the needle valve closes the fuel opening and shuts\\noff the fuel flow to the carburetor. The needle valve\\nopens again when the engine requires additional fuel.\\nThe flow of the fuel/air mixture to the combustion\\nchambers is regulated by the throttle valve, which is\\ncontrolled by the throttle in the cockpit.\\nMIXTURE CONTROL\\nCarburetors are normally calibrated at sea-level\\npressure, where the correct fuel-to-air mixture ratio is\\nestablished with the mixture control set in the FULL\\nRICH position. However, as altitude increases, the\\ndensity of air entering the carburetor decreases, while\\nthe density of the fuel remains the same. This creates a\\nFigure 5-6.

The\\nroughness normally is due to spark plug fouling from\\nexcessive carbon buildup on the plugs. Carbon buildup\\noccurs because the excessively rich mixture lowers the\\ntemperature inside the cylinder, inhibiting complete\\ncombustion of the fuel. This condition may occur\\nduring the pretakeoff runup at high-elevation airports\\nand during climbs or cruise flight at high altitudes.

Ice generally forms in the vicinity of the\\nthrottle valve and in the venturi throat. This restricts\\nthe flow of the fuel/air mixture and reduces power. If\\nenough ice builds up, the engine may cease to operate.\\nCarburetor ice is most likely to occur when\\ntemperatures are below 70°F (21°C) and the relative\\nhumidity is above 80 percent. However, due to the\\nsudden cooling that takes place in the carburetor, icing\\ncan occur even with temperatures as high as 100°F\\n(38°C) and humidity as low as 50 percent. This\\ntemperature drop can be as much as 60 to 70°F.\\nTherefore, at an outside air temperature of 100°F, a\\ntemperature drop of 70°F results in an air temperature\\nin the carburetor of 30°F. [Figure 5-9]\\nThe first indication of carburetor icing in an airplane\\nwith a fixed-pitch propeller is a decrease in engine\\nr.p.m., which may be followed by engine roughness. In\\nan airplane with a constant-speed propeller, carburetor\\nicing usually is indicated by a decrease in manifold\\npressure, but no reduction in r.p.m. Propeller pitch is\\nautomatically adjusted to compensate for loss of\\npower. Thus, a constant r.p.m. is maintained. Although\\ncarburetor ice can occur during any phase of flight, it is\\nparticularly dangerous when using reduced power\\nduring a descent. Under certain conditions, carburetor\\nice could build unnoticed until you try to add power. To\\ncombat the effects of carburetor ice, engines with\\nfloat-type carburetors employ a carburetor heat system.\\nCARBURETOR HEAT\\nCarburetor heat is an anti-icing system that preheats\\nthe air before it reaches the carburetor. Carburetor heat\\nis intended to keep the fuel/air mixture above the\\nfreezing temperature to prevent the formation\\nof carburetor ice. Carburetor heat can be used to melt\\nice that has already formed in the carburetor\\nprovided that the accumulation is not too great. The\\nemphasis, however, is on using carburetor heat as a\\npreventative measure.\\nThe carburetor heat should be checked during the\\nengine runup. When using carburetor heat, follow the\\nmanufacturer’s recommendations.\\nWhen conditions are conducive to carburetor icing\\nduring flight, periodic checks should be made to detect\\nits presence. If detected, full carburetor heat should be\\napplied immediately, and it should be left in the ON\\nposition until you are certain that all the ice has been\\nremoved. If ice is present, applying partial heat or\\nleaving heat on for an insufficient time might aggravate\\nthe situation. In extreme cases of carburetor icing, even\\nafter the ice has been removed, full carburetor heat\\nshould be used to prevent further ice formation. A\\ncarburetor temperature gauge, if installed, is very\\nuseful in determining when to use carburetor heat.\\nWhenever the throttle is closed during flight, the\\nengine cools rapidly and vaporization of the fuel is less\\ncomplete than if the engine is warm. Also, in this\\ncondition, the engine is more susceptible to carburetor\\nicing. Therefore, if you suspect carburetor icing\\nconditions and anticipate closed-throttle operation,\\nadjust the carburetor heat to the full ON position before\\nclosing the throttle, and leave it on during the\\nclosed-throttle operation. The heat will aid in\\nvaporizing the fuel, and help prevent the formation of\\ncarburetor ice. Periodically, open the throttle smoothly\\nfor a few seconds to keep the engine warm, otherwise\\nthe carburetor heater may not provide enough heat to\\nprevent icing.\\nThe use of carburetor heat causes a decrease in engine\\npower, sometimes up to 15 percent, because the heated\\nair is less dense than the outside air that had been\\nentering the engine. This enriches the mixture. When\\nice is present in an airplane with a fixed-pitch propeller\\nand carburetor heat is being used, there is a decrease in\\nr.p.m., followed by a gradual increase in r.p.m. as the\\nice melts. The engine also should run more smoothly\\nafter the ice has been removed. If ice is not present, the\\nr.p.m. will decrease, then remain constant. When\\ncarburetor heat is used on an airplane with a\\nconstant-speed propeller, and ice is present, a decrease\\nin the manifold pressure will be noticed, followed by a\\ngradual increase. If carburetor icing is not present, the\\ngradual increase in manifold pressure will not be\\napparent until the carburetor heat is turned off.\\nIt is imperative that a pilot recognizes carburetor ice\\nwhen it forms during flight. In addition, a loss of\\npower, altitude, and/or airspeed will occur. These\\nsymptoms may sometimes be accompanied by\\nvibration or engine roughness.

This is accomplished by\\napplying full carburetor heat, which will cause a\\nfurther reduction in power, and possibly engine\\nroughness as melted ice goes through the engine. These\\nsymptoms may last from 30 seconds to several\\nminutes, depending on the severity of the icing. During\\nthis period, the pilot must resist the temptation to\\ndecrease the carburetor heat usage.

Usually, the face of the\\ngauge is calibrated in degrees Celsius ( °C), with a\\nyellow arc indicating the carburetor air temperatures\\nwhere icing may occur. This yellow arc typically\\nranges between -15°C and +5°C (5°F and 41°F). If the\\nair temperature and moisture content of the air are such\\nthat carburetor icing is improbable, the engine can be\\noperated with the indicator in the yellow range with no\\nadverse effects. However, if the atmospheric conditions\\nare conducive to carburetor icing, the indicator must be\\nkept outside the yellow arc by application of\\ncarburetor heat.\\nCertain carburetor air temperature gauges have a red\\nradial, which indicates the maximum permissible\\ncarburetor inlet air temperature recommended by the\\nengine manufacturer; also, a green arc may be included\\nto indicate the normal operating range.\\nOUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE GAUGE\\nMost airplanes also are equipped with an outside air\\ntemperature (OAT) gauge calibrated in both degrees\\nCelsius and Fahrenheit. It provides the outside or\\nambient air temperature for calculating true\\nairspeed, and also is useful in detecting potential\\nicing conditions.\\nFUEL INJECTION SYSTEMS\\nIn a fuel injection system, the fuel is injected either\\ndirectly into the cylinders, or just ahead of the intake\\nvalve. A fuel injection system is considered to be less\\nsusceptible to icing than the carburetor system. Impact\\nicing on the air intake, however, is a possibility in\\neither system. Impact icing occurs when ice forms on\\nthe exterior of the airplane, and blocks openings such\\nas the air intake for the injection system.\\nThe air intake for the fuel injection system is similar to\\nthat used in the carburetor system, with an alternate air\\nsource located within the engine cowling. This source\\nis used if the external air source is obstructed. The\\nalternate air source is usually operated automatically,\\nwith a backup manual system that can be used if the\\nautomatic feature malfunctions.\\nA fuel injection system usually incorporates these basic\\ncomponents—an engine-driven fuel pump, a fuel/air\\ncontrol unit, fuel manifold (fuel distributor), discharge\\nnozzles, an auxiliary fuel pump, and fuel pressure/flow\\nindicators. [Figure 5-10]\\nThe auxiliary fuel pump provides fuel under pressure\\nto the fuel/air control unit for engine starting and/or\\nemergency use. After starting, the engine-driven fuel\\npump provides fuel under pressure from the fuel tank\\nto the fuel/air control unit. This control unit, which\\nessentially replaces the carburetor, meters fuel based\\non the mixture control setting, and sends it to the fuel\\nmanifold valve at a rate controlled by the throttle. After\\nreaching the fuel manifold valve, the fuel is distributed\\nto the individual fuel discharge nozzles. The discharge\\nnozzles, which are located in each cylinder head, inject\\nthe fuel/air mixture directly into each cylinder\\nintake port.\\nSome of the advantages of fuel injection are:\\n• Reduction in evaporative icing.\\n• Better fuel flow.\\n• Faster throttle response.\\n• Precise control of mixture.\\n• Better fuel distribution.\\n• Easier cold weather starts.\\nFuel\\nManifold\\nValve\\nFuel\\nDischarge\\nNozzle\\nFuel/Air\\nControl\\nUnit\\nEngine-Driven\\nFuel Pump\\nFuel Tank\\nAuxiliary\\nFuel Pump\\nFigure 5-10.

Airplanes with these systems have a manifold\\npressure gauge, which displays manifold absolute\\npressure (MAP) within the engine’s intake manifold.\\nOn a standard day at sea level with the engine shut\\ndown, the manifold pressure gauge will indicate the\\nambient absolute air pressure of 29.92 in. Hg. Because\\natmospheric pressure decreases approximately 1 in. Hg\\nper 1,000 feet of altitude increase, the manifold\\npressure gauge will indicate approximately 24.92 in.\\nHg at an airport that is 5,000 feet above sea level with\\nstandard day conditions.\\nAs a normally aspirated aircraft climbs, it eventually\\nreaches an altitude where the MAP is insufficient for a\\nnormal climb. That altitude limit is the aircraft’s\\nservice ceiling , and it is directly affected by the\\nengine’s ability to produce power. If the induction air\\nentering the engine is pressurized, or boosted, by either\\na supercharger or a turbosupercharger, the aircraft’s\\nservice ceiling can be increased. With these systems,\\nyou can fly at higher altitudes with the advantage of\\nhigher true airspeeds and the increased ability to\\ncircumnavigate adverse weather.\\nSUPERCHARGERS\\nA supercharger is an engine-driven air pump or\\ncompressor that increases manifold pressure and forces\\nthe fuel/air mixture into the cylinders. The higher the\\nmanifold pressure, the more dense the fuel/air mixture,\\nand the more power an engine can produce. With a\\nnormally aspirated engine, it is not possible to have\\nmanifold pressure higher than the existing atmospheric\\npressure. A supercharger is capable of boosting\\nmanifold pressure above 30 in. Hg.\\nThe components in a supercharged induction system\\nare similar to those in a normally aspirated system, with\\nthe addition of a supercharger between the fuel\\nmetering device and intake manifold. A supercharger is\\ndriven by the engine through a gear train at one speed,\\ntwo speeds, or variable speeds. In addition,\\nsuperchargers can have one or more stages. Each stage\\nprovides an increase in pressure. Therefore,\\nsuperchargers may be classified as single stage, two\\nstage, or multistage, depending on the number of times\\ncompression occurs.\\nAn early version of a single-stage, single-speed\\nsupercharger may be referred to as a sea-level\\nsupercharger. An engine equipped with this type of\\nsupercharger is called a sea-level engine . With this\\ntype of supercharger, a single gear-driven impeller is\\nused to increase the power produced by an engine at all\\naltitudes. The drawback, however, is that with this type\\nof supercharger, engine power output still decreases\\nwith an increase in altitude, in the same way that it does\\nwith a normally aspirated engine.\\nSingle-stage, single-speed superchargers are found on\\nmany high-powered radial engines, and use an air\\nintake that faces forward so the induction system can\\ntake full advantage of the ram air. Intake air passes\\nthrough ducts to a carburetor, where fuel is metered in\\nproportion to the airflow. The fuel/air charge is then\\nducted to the supercharger, or blower impeller, which\\naccelerates the fuel/air mixture outward. Once\\naccelerated, the fuel/air mixture passes through a\\ndiffuser, where air velocity is traded for pressure\\nenergy. After compression, the resulting high pressure\\nfuel/air mixture is directed to the cylinders.\\nSome of the large radial engines developed during\\nWorld War II have a single-stage, two-speed\\nsupercharger. With this type of supercharger, a single\\nimpeller may be operated at two speeds. The low\\nimpeller speed is often referred to as the low blower\\nsetting, while the high impeller speed is called the high\\nblower setting. On engines equipped with a two-speed\\nsupercharger, a lever or switch in the cockpit activates\\nan oil-operated clutch that switches from one speed to\\nthe other.\\nUnder normal operations, takeoff is made with the\\nsupercharger in the low blower position. In this mode,\\nthe engine performs as a ground-boosted engine, and\\nthe power output decreases as the aircraft gains\\naltitude. However, once the aircraft reaches a specified\\naltitude, a power reduction is made, and the\\nsupercharger control is switched to the high blower\\nposition. The throttle is then reset to the desired\\nService Ceiling—The maximum density altitude where the best rate-of-\\nclimb airspeed will produce a 100 feet-per-minute climb at maximum\\nweight while in a clean configuration with maximum continuous power.\\nSupercharger—An engine-driven air compressor used to provide\\nadditional pressure to the induction air so the engine can produce addi-\\ntional power.\\nSea-Level Engine—A reciprocating aircraft engine having a rated\\ntakeoff power that is producible only at sea level.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-9'),\n",

An engine equipped with this type\\nof supercharger is called an altitude engine .\\n[Figure 5-11]\\nTURBOSUPERCHARGERS\\nThe most efficient method of increasing horsepower in\\na reciprocating engine is by use of a turbosupercharger,\\nor turbocharger, as it is usually called. A drawback of\\ngear-driven superchargers is that they use a large\\namount of the engine’s power output for the amount of\\npower increase they produce. This problem is avoided\\nwith a turbocharger, because turbochargers are\\npowered by an engine’s exhaust gases. This means a\\nturbocharger recovers energy from hot exhaust gases\\nthat would otherwise be lost.\\nAnother advantage of turbochargers is that they can be\\ncontrolled to maintain an engine’s rated sea-level\\nhorsepower from sea level up to the engine’s critical\\naltitude. Critical altitude is the maximum altitude at\\nwhich a turbocharged engine can produce its rated\\nhorsepower. Above the critical altitude, power output\\nbegins to decrease like it does for a normally aspirated\\nengine.\\nTurbochargers increase the pressure of the engine’s\\ninduction air, which allows the engine to develop sea\\nlevel or greater horsepower at higher altitudes. A\\nturbocharger is comprised of two main elements—a\\nturbine and a compressor. The compressor section\\nhouses an impeller that turns at a high rate of speed. As\\ninduction air is drawn across the impeller blades, the\\nimpeller accelerates the air, allowing a large volume of\\nair to be drawn into the compressor housing. The\\nimpeller’s action subsequently produces high-pressure,\\nhigh-density air, which is delivered to the engine. To\\nturn the impeller, the engine’s exhaust gases are used to\\ndrive a turbine wheel that is mounted on the opposite\\nend of the impeller’s drive shaft. By directing different\\namounts of exhaust gases to flow over the turbine,\\nmore energy can be extracted, causing the impeller to\\ndeliver more compressed air to the engine. The waste\\ngate is used to vary the mass of exhaust gas flowing\\ninto the turbine. A waste gate is essentially an\\nadjustable butterfly valve that is installed in the exhaust\\nsystem. When closed, most of the exhaust gases from\\nthe engine are forced to flow through the turbine. When\\nopen, the exhaust gases are allowed to bypass the\\nturbine by flowing directly out through the engine’s\\nexhaust pipe. [Figure 5-12]\\nSince the temperature of a gas rises when it is\\ncompressed, turbocharging causes the temperature of\\nthe induction air to increase. To reduce this\\ntemperature and lower the risk of detonation, many\\nturbocharged engines use an intercooler. An\\nintercooler is a small heat exchanger that uses outside\\nair to cool the hot compressed air before it enters the\\nfuel metering device.\\nSYSTEM OPERATION\\nOn most modern turbocharged engines, the position of\\nthe waste gate is governed by a pressure-sensing\\ncontrol mechanism coupled to an actuator. Engine oil\\ndirected into or away from this actuator moves the\\nwaste gate position. On these systems, the actuator is\\nautomatically positioned to produce the desired MAP\\nsimply by changing the position of the throttle control.\\nOther turbocharging system designs use a separate\\nmanual control to position the waste gate. With manual\\ncontrol, you must closely monitor the manifold\\npressure gauge to determine when the desired MAP has\\nbeen achieved. Manual systems are often found on\\naircraft that have been modified with aftermarket\\nturbocharging systems. These systems require special\\noperating considerations. For example, if the waste\\ngate is left closed after descending from a high altitude,\\nit is possible to produce a manifold pressure that\\nexceeds the engine’s limitations.

To help\\nprevent overboosting, you should advance the throttle\\ncautiously to prevent exceeding the maximum\\nmanifold pressure limits.\\nThere are system limitations that you should be aware\\nof when flying an aircraft with a turbocharger. For\\ninstance, a turbocharger turbine and impeller can\\noperate at rotational speeds in excess of 80,000 r.p.m.\\nwhile at extremely high temperatures. To achieve high\\nrotational speed, the bearings within the system must\\nbe constantly supplied with engine oil to reduce the\\nfrictional forces and high temperature. To obtain\\nadequate lubrication, the oil temperature should be in\\nthe normal operating range before high throttle settings\\nare applied.

Otherwise, the oil\\nremaining in the bearing housing will boil, causing\\nhard carbon deposits to form on the bearings and shaft.\\nThese deposits rapidly deteriorate the turbocharger’s\\nefficiency and service life. For further limitations, refer\\nto the AFM/POH.\\nHIGH ALTITUDE PERFORMANCE\\nAs an aircraft equipped with a turbocharging system\\nclimbs, the waste gate is gradually closed to maintain\\nthe maximum allowable manifold pressure. At some\\npoint, however, the waste gate will be fully closed, and\\nwith further increases in altitude, the manifold pressure\\nwill begin to decrease.

The magneto generates\\nsufficiently high voltage to jump a spark across the\\nspark plug gap in each cylinder. The system begins to\\nfire when you engage the starter and the crankshaft\\nbegins to turn. It continues to operate whenever the\\ncrankshaft is rotating.\\nMost standard certificated airplanes incorporate a dual\\nignition system with two individual magnetos, separate\\nsets of wires, and spark plugs to increase reliability\\nof the ignition system. Each magneto operates\\nindependently to fire one of the two spark plugs in each\\ncylinder. The firing of two spark plugs improves\\ncombustion of the fuel/air mixture and results in a\\nslightly higher power output. If one of the magnetos\\nfails, the other is unaffected. The engine will continue\\nto operate normally, although you can expect a slight\\ndecrease in engine power. The same is true if one of the\\ntwo spark plugs in a cylinder fails.\\nThe operation of the magneto is controlled in the\\ncockpit by the ignition switch. The switch has\\nfive positions:\\n1. OFF\\n2. R—Right\\n3. L—Left\\n4. BOTH\\n5. START\\nWith RIGHT or LEFT selected, only the associated\\nmagneto is activated. The system operates on both\\nmagnetos with BOTH selected.\\nYou can identify a malfunctioning ignition system\\nduring the pretakeoff check by observing the decrease\\nin r.p.m. that occurs when you first move the ignition\\nswitch from BOTH to RIGHT, and then from BOTH to\\nLEFT. A small decrease in engine r.p.m. is normal\\nduring this check. The permissible decrease is listed in\\nthe AFM or POH. If the engine stops running when you\\nswitch to one magneto or if the r.p.m. drop exceeds the\\nallowable limit, do not fly the airplane until the\\nproblem is corrected. The cause could be fouled plugs,\\nbroken or shorted wires between the magneto and the\\nplugs, or improperly timed firing of the plugs. It should\\nbe noted that “no drop” in r.p.m. is not normal, and in\\nthat instance, the airplane should not be flown.\\nFollowing engine shutdown, turn the ignition switch to\\nthe OFF position. Even with the battery and master\\nswitches OFF, the engine can fire and turn over if you\\nleave the ignition switch ON and the propeller is\\nmoved because the magneto requires no outside source\\nof electrical power. The potential for serious injury in\\nthis situation is obvious.\\nLoose or broken wires in the ignition system also can\\ncause problems. For example, if the ignition switch is\\nOFF, the magneto may continue to fire if the ignition\\nswitch ground wire is disconnected. If this occurs, the\\nonly way to stop the engine is to move the\\nmixture lever to the idle cutoff position, then have the\\nsystem checked by a qualified aviation maintenance\\ntechnician.\\nCOMBUSTION\\nDuring normal combustion, the fuel/air mixture burns\\nin a very controlled and predictable manner. Although\\nthe process occurs in a fraction of a second, the mixture\\nactually begins to burn at the point where it is ignited\\nby the spark plugs, then burns away from the plugs\\nuntil it is all consumed. This type of combustion causes\\na smooth buildup of temperature and pressure and\\nensures that the expanding gases deliver the maximum\\nforce to the piston at exactly the right time in the power\\nstroke. [Figure 5-14]\\nDetonation is an uncontrolled, explosive ignition of\\nthe fuel/air mixture within the cylinder’s combustion\\nchamber. It causes excessive temperatures and\\npressures which, if not corrected, can quickly lead to\\nfailure of the piston, cylinder, or valves. In less severe\\ncases, detonation causes engine overheating,\\nroughness, or loss of power.\\nDetonation is characterized by high cylinder head\\ntemperatures, and is most likely to occur when\\noperating at high power settings. Some common\\noperational causes of detonation include:\\nMagneto—A self-contained, engine-driven unit that supplies electrical\\ncurrent to the spark plugs; completely independent of the airplane’s\\nelectrical system. Normally, there are two magnetos per engine.\\nNormal Combustion Explosion\\nFigure 5-14.

Premature\\nburning is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the\\ncombustion chamber, often created by a small carbon\\ndeposit on a spark plug, a cracked spark plug insulator,\\nor other damage in the cylinder that causes a part to\\nheat sufficiently to ignite the fuel/air charge.\\nPreignition causes the engine to lose power, and\\nproduces high operating temperature.

The main pump system is engine driven, and an\\nelectrically driven auxiliary pump is provided for use\\nin engine starting and in the event the engine pump\\nfails. The auxiliary pump, also known as a boost pump,\\nprovides added reliability to the fuel system. The\\nelectrically driven auxiliary pump is controlled by a\\nswitch in the cockpit.\\nFUEL PRIMER\\nBoth gravity fed and pump systems may incorporate a\\nfuel primer into the system. The primer is used to draw\\nfuel from the tanks to vaporize it directly into the\\ncylinders prior to starting the engine. This is\\nparticularly helpful during cold weather, when engines\\nare hard to start because there is not enough heat\\navailable to vaporize the fuel in the carburetor. It is\\nimportant to lock the primer in place when it is not in\\nuse. If the knob is free to move, it may vibrate out\\nduring flight and can cause an excessively rich\\nmixture. To avoid overpriming, read the priming\\ninstructions for your airplane.\\nFUEL TANKS\\nThe fuel tanks, normally located inside the wings of an\\nairplane, have a filler opening on top of the wing\\nthrough which they can be filled. A filler cap covers\\nthis opening. The tanks are vented to the outside to\\nmaintain atmospheric pressure inside the tank. They\\nmay be vented through the filler cap or through a tube\\nextending through the surface of the wing. Fuel tanks\\nalso include an overflow drain that may stand alone or\\nbe collocated with the fuel tank vent. This allows fuel\\nto expand with increases in temperature without\\ndamage to the tank itself. If the tanks have been filled\\non a hot day, it is not unusual to see fuel coming from\\nthe overflow drain.\\nFUEL GAUGES\\nThe fuel quantity gauges indicate the amount of fuel\\nmeasured by a sensing unit in each fuel tank and is\\ndisplayed in gallons or pounds. Aircraft certification\\nrules only require accuracy in fuel gauges when they\\nread “empty.” Any reading other than “empty” should\\nbe verified. Do not depend solely on the accuracy of\\nthe fuel quantity gauges. Always visually check the\\nfuel level in each tank during the preflight inspection,\\nand then compare it with the corresponding fuel\\nquantity indication.\\nIf a fuel pump is installed in the fuel system, a fuel\\npressure gauge is also included. This gauge indicates\\nthe pressure in the fuel lines. The normal operating\\npressure can be found in the AFM/POH, or on the\\ngauge by color coding.\\nFUEL SELECTORS\\nThe fuel selector valve allows selection of fuel from\\nvarious tanks. A common type of selector valve\\ncontains four positions: LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH, and\\nOFF. Selecting the LEFT or RIGHT position allows\\nfuel to feed only from that tank, while selecting the\\nBOTH position feeds fuel from both tanks. The LEFT\\nor RIGHT position may be used to balance the amount\\nof fuel remaining in each wing tank. [Figure 5-16]\\nFuel placards will show any limitations on fuel tank\\nusage, such as “level flight only” and/or “both” for\\nlandings and takeoffs.\\nRegardless of the type of fuel selector in use, fuel\\nconsumption should be monitored closely to ensure\\nthat a tank does not run completely out of fuel. Running\\na fuel tank dry will not only cause the engine to stop,\\nbut running for prolonged periods on one tank causes\\nan unbalanced fuel load between tanks. Running a tank\\ncompletely dry may allow air to enter the fuel system,\\nwhich may cause vapor lock. When this situation\\ndevelops, it may be difficult to restart the engine. On\\nfuel-injected engines, the fuel may become so hot it\\nvaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing fuel to reach\\nthe cylinders.\\nFUEL STRAINERS, SUMPS, AND DRAINS\\nAfter the fuel selector valve, the fuel passes through a\\nstrainer before it enters the carburetor. This strainer\\nremoves moisture and other sediments that might be in\\nthe system. Since these contaminants are heavier than\\naviation fuel, they settle in a sump at the bottom of the\\nstrainer assembly. A sump is defined as a low point in a\\nfuel system and/or fuel tank. The fuel system may\\ncontain sump, fuel strainer, and fuel tank drains, some\\nof which may be collocated.\\nThe fuel strainer should be drained before each flight.\\nFuel samples should be drained and checked visually\\nFigure 5-16.

Water in the sump is\\nhazardous because in cold weather the water can freeze\\nand block fuel lines. In warm weather, it can flow into\\nthe carburetor and stop the engine. If water is present in\\nthe sump, it is likely there is more water in the fuel\\ntanks, and you should continue to drain them until there\\nis no evidence of water. In any event, never take off\\nuntil you are certain that all water and contaminants\\nhave been removed from the engine fuel system.\\nBecause of the variation in fuel systems, you should\\nbecome thoroughly familiar with the systems that apply\\nto your airplane. Consult the AFM or POH for specific\\noperating procedures.\\nFUEL GRADES\\nAviation gasoline, or AVGAS, is identified by an\\noctane or performance number (grade), which\\ndesignates the antiknock value or knock resistance of\\nthe fuel mixture in the engine cylinder. The higher the\\ngrade of gasoline, the more pressure the fuel can\\nwithstand without detonating. Lower grades of fuel are\\nused in lower-compression engines because these fuels\\nignite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used in\\nhigher-compression engines, because they must ignite\\nat higher temperatures, but not prematurely. If the\\nproper grade of fuel is not available, use the next higher\\ngrade as a substitute. Never use a lower grade. This can\\ncause the cylinder head temperature and engine oil\\ntemperature to exceed their normal operating range,\\nwhich may result in detonation.\\nSeveral grades of aviation fuel are available. Care must\\nbe exercised to ensure that the correct aviation grade is\\nbeing used for the specific type of engine. The proper\\nfuel grade is stated in the AFM or POH, on placards in\\nthe cockpit, and next to the filler caps. Due to its lead\\ncontent, auto gas should NEVER be used in aircraft\\nengines unless the aircraft has been modified with a\\nSupplemental Type Certificate (STC) issued by the\\nFederal Aviation Administration.\\nThe current method to identify aviation gasoline for\\naircraft with reciprocating engines is by the octane and\\nperformance number, along with the abbreviation\\nAVGAS. These aircraft use AVGAS 80, 100, and\\n100LL. Although A VGAS 100LL performs the same as\\ngrade 100, the “LL” indicates it has a low lead content.\\nFuel for aircraft with turbine engines is classified as\\nJET A, JET A-1, and JET B. Jet fuel is basically\\nkerosene and has a distinctive kerosene smell.\\nSince use of the correct fuel is critical, dyes are\\nadded to help identify the type and grade of fuel.\\n[Figure 5-17]\\nIn addition to the color of the fuel itself, the\\ncolor-coding system extends to decals and various\\nairport fuel handling equipment. For example, all\\naviation gasolines are identified by name, using white\\nletters on a red background. In contrast, turbine fuels\\nare identified by white letters on a black background.\\nFUEL CONTAMINATION\\nOf the accidents attributed to powerplant failure from\\nfuel contamination, most have been traced to:\\n• Inadequate preflight inspection by the pilot.\\n• Servicing aircraft with improperly filtered fuel\\nfrom small tanks or drums.\\n• Storing aircraft with partially filled fuel tanks.\\n• Lack of proper maintenance.\\nFuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick\\ndrain and from each fuel tank sump into a transparent\\ncontainer, and then checked for dirt and water. When\\nthe fuel strainer is being drained, water in the tank may\\nnot appear until all the fuel has been drained from the\\nlines leading to the tank. This indicates that water\\nremains in the tank, and is not forcing the fuel out of\\nthe fuel lines leading to the fuel strainer. Therefore,\\ndrain enough fuel from the fuel strainer to be certain\\nthat fuel is being drained from the tank. The amount\\nwill depend on the length of fuel line from the tank to\\nthe drain.

This residual water can be removed only\\nby draining the fuel tank sump drains.\\nWater is the principal fuel contaminant. Suspended\\nwater droplets in the fuel can be identified by a cloudy\\nappearance of the fuel or by the clear separation of\\nwater from the colored fuel, which occurs after the\\nwater has settled to the bottom of the tank. As a safety\\nmeasure, the fuel sumps should be drained before every\\nflight during the preflight inspection.\\nFuel tanks should be filled after each flight, or at least\\nafter the last flight of the day to prevent moisture\\ncondensation within the tank. Another way to prevent\\nfuel contamination is to avoid refueling from cans and\\ndrums. Refueling from cans or drums may result in fuel\\ncontamination.\\nThe use of a funnel and chamois skin when refueling\\nfrom cans or drums is hazardous under any conditions,\\nand should be discouraged. In remote areas or in\\nemergency situations, there may be no alternative to\\nrefueling from sources with inadequate anticontamina-\\ntion systems, and a chamois and funnel may be the only\\npossible means of filtering fuel. However, the use of a\\nchamois will not always ensure decontaminated fuel.\\nWorn-out chamois will not filter water; neither will a\\nnew, clean chamois that is already water-wet or damp.\\nMost imitation chamois skins will not filter water.\\nREFUELING PROCEDURES\\nStatic electricity is formed by the friction of air passing\\nover the surfaces of an airplane in flight and by the flow\\nof fuel through the hose and nozzle during refueling.\\nNylon, dacron, or wool clothing is especially prone to\\naccumulate and discharge static electricity from the\\nperson to the funnel or nozzle. To guard against the\\npossibility of static electricity igniting fuel fumes, a\\nground wire should be attached to the aircraft before\\nthe fuel cap is removed from the tank. The refueling\\nnozzle then should be grounded to the aircraft before\\nrefueling is begun, and should remain grounded\\nthroughout the refueling process. When a fuel truck is\\nused, it should be grounded prior to the fuel nozzle\\ncontacting the aircraft.\\nIf fueling from drums or cans is necessary, proper\\nbonding and grounding connections are important.\\nDrums should be placed near grounding posts, and the\\nfollowing sequence of connections observed:\\n1. Drum to ground.\\n2. Ground to aircraft.\\n3. Drum to aircraft.\\n4. Nozzle to aircraft before the fuel cap is removed.\\nWhen disconnecting, reverse the order.\\nThe passage of fuel through a chamois increases the\\ncharge of static electricity and the danger of sparks. The\\naircraft must be properly grounded and the nozzle,\\nchamois filter, and funnel bonded to the aircraft. If a\\ncan is used, it should be connected to either the\\ngrounding post or the funnel. Under no circumstances\\nshould a plastic bucket or similar nonconductive\\ncontainer be used in this operation.\\nSTARTING SYSTEM\\nMost small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter\\nsystem. This system consists of a source of electricity,\\nwiring, switches, and solenoids to operate the starter\\nand a starter motor. Most aircraft have starters that\\nautomatically engage and disengage when operated,\\nbut some older aircraft have starters that are\\nmechanically engaged by a lever actuated by the pilot.\\nThe starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating the\\nengine at a speed that allows the engine to start and\\nmaintain operation.\\nElectrical power for starting is usually supplied by an\\non-board battery, but can also be supplied by external\\npower through an external power receptacle. When the\\nbattery switch is turned on, electricity is supplied to the\\nmain power bus through the battery solenoid. Both the\\nstarter and the starter switch draw current from the main\\nbus, but the starter will not operate until the starting\\nsolenoid is energized by the starter switch being turned\\nto the “start” position. When the starter switch is released\\nfrom the “start” position, the solenoid removes power\\nfrom the starter motor. The starter motor is protected\\nfrom being driven by the engine through a clutch in the\\nstarter drive that allows the engine to run faster than the\\nstarter motor. [Figure 5-18]\\nWhen starting an engine, the rules of safety and\\ncourtesy should be strictly observed. One of the most\\nimportant is to make sure there is no one near the\\npropeller. In addition, the wheels should be chocked\\nand the brakes set, to avoid hazards caused by\\nunintentional movement. To avoid damage to the\\npropeller and property, the airplane should be in an area\\nwhere the propeller will not stir up gravel or dust.\\nOIL SYSTEMS\\nThe engine oil system performs several important\\nfunctions, including:\\n• Lubrication of the engine’s moving parts.\\n• Cooling of the engine by reducing friction.\\n• Removing heat from the cylinders.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-16'),\n",

In a dry-sump system, the oil is\\ncontained in a separate tank, and circulated through the\\nengine by pumps. In a wet-sump system, the oil is\\nlocated in a sump, which is an integral part of the\\nengine. [Figure 5-19]\\nThe main component of a wet-sump system is the oil\\npump, which draws oil from the sump and routes it to\\nthe engine. After the oil passes through the engine, it\\nreturns to the sump. In some engines, additional\\nlubrication is supplied by the rotating crankshaft,\\nwhich splashes oil onto portions of the engine.\\nAn oil pump also supplies oil pressure in a dry-sump\\nsystem, but the source of the oil is a separate oil tank,\\nlocated external to the engine. After oil is routed\\nthrough the engine, it is pumped from the various\\nlocations in the engine back to the oil tank by scavenge\\npumps. Dry sump systems allow for a greater volume\\nof oil to be supplied to the engine, which makes them\\nmore suitable for very large reciprocating engines.\\nThe oil pressure gauge provides a direct indication of\\nthe oil system operation.

The AFM, POH, or placards near the\\naccess panel provide information about the correct oil\\ntype and weight, as well as the minimum and maximum\\noil quantity. [Figure 5-20]\\nENGINE COOLING SYSTEMS\\nThe burning fuel within the cylinders produces intense\\nheat, most of which is expelled through the exhaust\\nsystem. Much of the remaining heat, however, must be\\nremoved, or at least dissipated, to prevent the engine\\nfrom overheating. Otherwise, the extremely high\\nengine temperatures can lead to loss of power,\\nexcessive oil consumption, detonation, and serious\\nengine damage.\\nWhile the oil system is vital to internal cooling of the\\nengine, an additional method of cooling is necessary\\nfor the engine’s external surface. Most small airplanes\\nare air cooled, although some are liquid cooled.\\nAir cooling is accomplished by air flowing into the\\nengine compartment through openings in front of the\\nengine cowling. Baffles route this air over fins attached\\nto the engine cylinders, and other parts of the engine,\\nwhere the air absorbs the engine heat. Expulsion of the\\nhot air takes place through one or more openings in the\\nlower, aft portion of the engine cowling. [Figure 5-21]\\nThe outside air enters the engine compartment through\\nan inlet behind the propeller hub. Baffles direct it to the\\nhottest parts of the engine, primarily the cylinders,\\nwhich have fins that increase the area exposed to\\nthe airflow.\\nThe air cooling system is less effective during ground\\noperations, takeoffs, go-arounds, and other periods of\\nhigh-power, low-airspeed operation. Conversely,\\nhigh-speed descents provide excess air and can\\nshock-cool the engine, subjecting it to abrupt\\ntemperature fluctuations.\\nFigure 5-20.

It will also lead to\\nserious permanent damage, such as scoring the\\ncylinder walls, damaging the pistons and rings, and\\nburning and warping the valves. Monitoring the\\ncockpit engine temperature instruments will aid in\\navoiding high operating temperature.\\nUnder normal operating conditions in airplanes not\\nequipped with cowl flaps, the engine temperature can\\nbe controlled by changing the airspeed or the power\\noutput of the engine. High engine temperatures can be\\ndecreased by increasing the airspeed and/or reducing\\nthe power.\\nThe oil temperature gauge gives an indirect and\\ndelayed indication of rising engine temperature, but\\ncan be used for determining engine temperature if this\\nis the only means available.\\nMany airplanes are equipped with a cylinder-head\\ntemperature gauge. This instrument indicates a direct\\nand immediate cylinder temperature change. This\\ninstrument is calibrated in degrees Celsius or\\nFahrenheit, and is usually color-coded with a green arc\\nto indicate the normal operating range. A red line on\\nthe instrument indicates maximum allowable cylinder\\nhead temperature.\\nTo avoid excessive cylinder head temperatures,\\nincrease airspeed, enrich the mixture, and/or reduce\\npower. Any of these procedures help in reducing the\\nengine temperature. On airplanes equipped with\\ncowl flaps , use the cowl flap positions to control the\\ntemperature. Cowl flaps are hinged covers that fit over\\nthe opening through which the hot air is expelled. If the\\nengine temperature is low, the cowl flaps can be closed,\\nthereby restricting the flow of expelled hot air and\\nincreasing engine temperature. If the engine\\ntemperature is high, the cowl flaps can be opened to\\npermit a greater flow of air through the system, thereby\\ndecreasing the engine temperature.\\nEXHAUST SYSTEMS\\nEngine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion\\ngases overboard, provide heat for the cabin, and defrost\\nthe windscreen. An exhaust system has exhaust piping\\nattached to the cylinders, as well as a muffler and a\\nmuffler shroud. The exhaust gases are pushed out of\\nthe cylinder through the exhaust valve and then through\\nthe exhaust pipe system to the atmosphere.\\nFor cabin heat, outside air is drawn into the air inlet\\nand is ducted through a shroud around the muffler. The\\nmuffler is heated by the exiting exhaust gases and, in\\nturn, heats the air around the muffler. This heated air is\\nthen ducted to the cabin for heat and defrost\\napplications. The heat and defrost are controlled in the\\ncockpit, and can be adjusted to the desired level.\\nExhaust gases contain large amounts of carbon\\nmonoxide, which is odorless and colorless. Carbon\\nmonoxide is deadly, and its presence is virtually\\nimpossible to detect. The exhaust system must be in\\ngood condition and free of cracks.\\nSome exhaust systems have an exhaust gas\\ntemperature probe. This probe transmits the exhaust\\ngas temperature (EGT) to an instrument in the cockpit.\\nThe EGT gauge measures the temperature of the gases\\nat the exhaust manifold. This temperature varies with\\nthe ratio of fuel to air entering the cylinders and can be\\nused as a basis for regulating the fuel/air mixture. The\\nEGT gauge is highly accurate in indicating the correct\\nmixture setting. When using the EGT to aid in leaning\\nthe fuel/air mixture, fuel consumption can be reduced.\\nFor specific procedures, refer to the manufacturer’s\\nrecommendations for leaning the mixture.\\nELECTRICAL SYSTEM\\nAirplanes are equipped with either a 14- or 28-volt\\ndirect-current electrical system. A basic airplane\\nelectrical system consists of the following components:\\n• Alternator/generator\\n• Battery\\n• Master/battery switch\\n• Alternator/generator switch\\n• Bus bar, fuses, and circuit breakers\\n• V oltage regulator\\n• Ammeter/loadmeter\\n• Associated electrical wiring\\nEngine-driven alternators or generators supply electric\\ncurrent to the electrical system. They also maintain a\\nsufficient electrical charge in the battery.

[Figure 5-22]\\nWith the alternator half of the switch in the OFF\\nposition, the entire electrical load is placed on the\\nbattery.

When all electrical com-\\nponents are turned off, it reflects only the amount of\\ncharging current demanded by the battery.\\nA voltage regulator controls the rate of charge to the\\nbattery by stabilizing the generator or alternator\\nelectrical output. The generator/alternator voltage\\noutput should be higher than the battery voltage. For\\nexample, a 12-volt battery would be fed by a\\ngenerator/alternator system of approximately 14 volts.\\nThe difference in voltage keeps the battery charged.\\nHYDRAULIC SYSTEMS\\nThere are multiple applications for hydraulic use in\\nairplanes, depending on the complexity of the airplane.\\nFor example, hydraulics are often used on small\\nairplanes to operate wheel brakes, retractable landing\\ngear, and some constant-speed propellers. On large\\nairplanes, hydraulics are used for flight control\\nsurfaces, wing flaps, spoilers, and other systems.\\nA basic hydraulic system consists of a reservoir, pump\\n(either hand, electric, or engine driven), a filter to keep\\nthe fluid clean, selector valve to control the direction of\\nflow, relief valve to relieve excess pressure, and an\\nactuator.\\nThe hydraulic fluid is pumped through the system to an\\nactuator or servo. Servos can be either single-acting or\\ndouble-acting servos based on the needs of the system.\\nThis means that the fluid can be applied to one or both\\nsides of the servo, depending on the servo type, and\\ntherefore provides power in one direction with a\\nsingle-acting servo. A servo is a cylinder with a piston\\ninside that turns fluid power into work and creates the\\npower needed to move an aircraft system or flight\\ncontrol. The selector valve allows the fluid direction to\\nbe controlled. This is necessary for operations like the\\nextension and retraction of landing gear where the fluid\\nmust work in two different directions. The relief valve\\nprovides an outlet for the system in the event of\\nexcessive fluid pressure in the system. Each system\\nincorporates different components to meet the\\nindividual needs of different aircraft.\\nA mineral-based fluid is the most widely used type for\\nsmall airplanes. This type of hydraulic fluid, which is a\\nkerosene-like petroleum product, has good lubricating\\nproperties, as well as additives to inhibit foaming and\\nprevent the formation of corrosion. It is quite stable\\nchemically, has very little viscosity change with\\ntemperature, and is dyed for identification. Since\\nseveral types of hydraulic fluids are commonly used,\\nmake sure your airplane is serviced with the type\\nspecified by the manufacturer. Refer to the AFM, POH,\\nor the Maintenance Manual. [Figure 5-25]\\nLANDING GEAR\\nThe landing gear forms the principal support of the\\nairplane on the surface. The most common type of\\nlanding gear consists of wheels, but airplanes can also\\nbe equipped with floats for water operations, or skis for\\nlanding on snow. [Figure 5-26]\\nThe landing gear on small airplanes consists of three\\nwheels\\uf8e7two main wheels, one located on each side of\\nthe fuselage, and a third wheel, positioned either at the\\nfront or rear of the airplane. Landing gear employing a\\nrear-mounted wheel is called a conventional landing\\ngear. Airplanes with conventional landing gear are\\noften referred to as tailwheel airplanes. When the third\\nwheel is located on the nose, it is called a nosewheel,\\nand the design is referred to as a tricycle gear. A\\nsteerable nosewheel or tailwheel permits the airplane\\nto be controlled throughout all operations while on\\nthe ground.\\nTRICYCLE LANDING GEAR AIRPLANES\\nA tricycle gear airplane has three main advantages:\\nServo—A motor or other form of actuator which receives a small signal\\nfrom the control device and exerts a large force to accomplish the\\ndesired work.\\nReservoir Double-\\nActing\\nCylinder\\nMotion\\nSelector Valve\\nC.V.

The\\nforward CG, therefore, tends to keep the airplane\\nmoving forward in a straight line rather than\\nground looping.\\nNosewheels are either steerable or castering. Steerable\\nnosewheels are linked to the rudders by cables or rods,\\nwhile castering nosewheels are free to swivel. In both\\ncases, you steer the airplane using the rudder pedals.\\nHowever, airplanes with a castering nosewheel may\\nrequire you to combine the use of the rudder pedals\\nwith independent use of the brakes.\\nTAILWHEEL LANDING GEAR AIRPLANES\\nOn tailwheel airplanes, two main wheels, which are\\nattached to the airframe ahead of its center of gravity,\\nsupport most of the weight of the structure, while a\\ntailwheel at the very back of the fuselage provides a\\nthird point of support. This arrangement allows\\nadequate ground clearance for a larger propeller and is\\nmore desirable for operations on unimproved fields.\\n[Figure 5-27]\\nThe main drawback with the tailwheel landing gear is\\nthat the center of gravity is behind the main gear. This\\nmakes directional control more difficult while on the\\nground. If you allow the airplane to swerve while\\nrolling on the ground at a speed below that at which the\\nrudder has sufficient control, the center of gravity will\\nattempt to get ahead of the main gear. This may cause\\nthe airplane to ground loop.\\nAnother disadvantage for tailwheel airplanes is the lack\\nof good forward visibility when the tailwheel is on or\\nnear the surface. Because of the associated hazards,\\nspecific training is required in tailwheel airplanes.\\nFIXED AND RETRACTABLE LANDING GEAR\\nLanding gear can also be classified as either fixed or\\nretractable. A fixed gear always remains extended and\\nhas the advantage of simplicity combined with low\\nmaintenance. A retractable gear is designed to\\nstreamline the airplane by allowing the landing gear to\\nbe stowed inside the structure during cruising flight.\\n[Figure 5-28]\\nBRAKES\\nAirplane brakes are located on the main wheels and are\\napplied by either a hand control or by foot pedals (toe\\nor heel). Foot pedals operate independently and allow\\nfor differential braking. During ground operations,\\ndifferential braking can supplement nosewheel/tail-\\nwheel steering.\\nAUTOPILOT\\nAutopilots are designed to control the aircraft and help\\nreduce the pilot’s workload. The limitations of the\\nautopilot depend on the complexity of the system. The\\nFigure 5-27. Tailwheel landing gear.\\nFigure 5-28.

More advanced systems may include\\na vertical speed and/or indicated airspeed hold\\nmode. Most autopilot systems are coupled to\\nnavigational aids.\\nAn autopilot system consists of servos that actuate the\\nflight controls. The number and location of these\\nservos depends on the complexity of the system. For\\nexample, a single-axis autopilot controls the aircraft\\nabout the longitudinal axis and a servo actuates the\\nailerons. A three-axis autopilot controls the aircraft\\nabout the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical axes; and\\nthree different servos actuate the ailerons, the elevator,\\nand the rudder.\\nThe autopilot system also incorporates a disconnect\\nsafety feature to automatically or manually disengage\\nthe system. Autopilots can also be manually\\noverridden. Because autopilot systems differ widely in\\ntheir operation, refer to the autopilot operating\\ninstructions in the AFM or POH.\\nPRESSURIZED AIRPLANES\\nWhen an airplane is flown at a high altitude, it\\nconsumes less fuel for a given airspeed than it does for\\nthe same speed at a lower altitude. In other words, the\\nairplane is more efficient at a high altitude. In addition,\\nbad weather and turbulence may be avoided by flying\\nin the relatively smooth air above the storms. Because\\nof the advantages of flying at high altitudes,\\nmany modern general aviation-type airplanes are\\nbeing designed to operate in that environment. It is\\nimportant that pilots transitioning to such sophisticated\\nequipment be familiar with at least the basic\\noperating principles.\\nA cabin pressurization system accomplishes several\\nfunctions in providing adequate passenger comfort and\\nsafety. It maintains a cabin pressure altitude of\\napproximately 8,000 feet at the maximum designed\\ncruising altitude of the airplane, and prevents rapid\\nchanges of cabin altitude that may be uncomfortable or\\ncause injury to passengers and crew. In addition, the\\npressurization system permits a reasonably fast\\nexchange of air from the inside to the outside of the\\ncabin. This is necessary to eliminate odors and to\\nremove stale air. [Figure 5-29]\\nPressurization of the airplane cabin is an accepted\\nmethod of protecting occupants against the effects of\\nhypoxia. Within a pressurized cabin, occupants can be\\ntransported comfortably and safely for long periods of\\ntime, particularly if the cabin altitude is maintained at\\n8,000 feet or below, where the use of oxygen\\nequipment is not required. The flight crew in this type\\nof airplane must be aware of the danger of accidental\\nloss of cabin pressure and must be prepared to deal with\\nsuch an emergency whenever it occurs.\\nIn the typical pressurization system, the cabin, flight\\ncompartment, and baggage compartments are\\nincorporated into a sealed unit that is capable of\\ncontaining air under a pressure higher than outside\\natmospheric pressure. On aircraft powered by turbine\\nengines, bleed air from the engine compressor section is\\nused to pressurize the cabin. Superchargers may be used\\non older model turbine powered airplanes to pump air\\ninto the sealed fuselage. Piston-powered airplanes may\\nuse air supplied from each engine turbocharger through\\na sonic venturi (flow limiter). Air is released from the\\nfuselage by a device called an outflow valve. The\\noutflow valve, by regulating the air exit, provides a\\nconstant inflow of air to the pressurized area.\\n[Figure 5-30]\\nTo understand the operating principles of\\npressurization and air-conditioning systems, it is\\nnecessary to become familiar with some of the related\\nterms and definitions, such as:\\n• Aircraft altitude —the actual height above sea\\nlevel at which the airplane is flying.\\n• Ambient temperature —the temperature in the\\narea immediately surrounding the airplane.\\nAltitude (ft) Pressure (p.s.i.)

In aircraft air-conditioning and pressurizing\\nsystems, it is the difference between cabin\\npressure and atmospheric pressure.\\nThe cabin pressure control system provides cabin\\npressure regulation, pressure relief, vacuum relief, and\\nthe means for selecting the desired cabin altitude in the\\nisobaric and differential range. In addition, dumping of\\nthe cabin pressure is a function of the pressure control\\nsystem. A cabin pressure regulator, an outflow valve,\\nand a safety valve are used to accomplish these\\nfunctions.\\nThe cabin pressure regulator controls cabin pressure to\\na selected value in the isobaric range and limits cabin\\npressure to a preset differential value in the differential\\nrange. When the airplane reaches the altitude at which\\nthe difference between the pressure inside and outside\\nthe cabin is equal to the highest differential pressure for\\nwhich the fuselage structure is designed, a further\\nincrease in airplane altitude will result in a\\ncorresponding increase in cabin altitude. Differential\\ncontrol is used to prevent the maximum differential\\npressure, for which the fuselage was designed, from\\nbeing exceeded. This differential pressure is\\ndetermined by the structural strength of the cabin and\\noften by the relationship of the cabin size to the\\nprobable areas of rupture, such as window areas\\nand doors.\\nThe cabin air pressure safety valve is a combination\\npressure relief, vacuum relief, and dump valve. The\\npressure relief valve prevents cabin pressure from\\nexceeding a predetermined differential pressure above\\nambient pressure. The vacuum relief prevents ambient\\npressure from exceeding cabin pressure by allowing\\nexternal air to enter the cabin when ambient pressure\\nexceeds cabin pressure. The cockpit control switch\\nactuates the dump valve. When this switch is\\npositioned to ram, a solenoid valve opens, causing the\\nvalve to dump cabin air to atmosphere.\\nThe degree of pressurization and the operating altitude\\nof the aircraft are limited by several critical design\\nfactors. Primarily the fuselage is designed to withstand\\na particular maximum cabin differential pressure.\\nSeveral instruments are used in conjunction with the\\npressurization controller. The cabin differential\\npressure gauge indicates the difference between inside\\nand outside pressure. This gauge should be monitored\\nto assure that the cabin does not exceed the maximum\\nallowable differential pressure. A cabin altimeter is also\\nprovided as a check on the performance of the system.\\nIn some cases, these two instruments are combined into\\none. A third instrument indicates the cabin rate of climb\\nor descent. A cabin rate-of-climb instrument and a\\ncabin altimeter are illustrated in Figure 5-31 on\\npage 5-26.\\nDecompression is defined as the inability of the\\nairplane’s pressurization system to maintain its designed\\npressure differential. This can be caused by a\\nmalfunction in the pressurization system or structural\\ndamage to the airplane.

The\\ncabin air will fill with fog, dust, or flying debris. Fog\\noccurs due to the rapid drop in temperature and the\\nchange of relative humidity. Normally, the ears clear\\nautomatically. Air will rush from the mouth and nose\\ndue to the escape of air from the lungs, and may be\\nnoticed by some individuals.\\nThe primary danger of decompression is hypoxia.\\nUnless proper utilization of oxygen equipment is\\naccomplished quickly, unconsciousness may occur in a\\nvery short time. The period of useful consciousness is\\nconsiderably shortened when a person is subjected to a\\nrapid decompression. This is due to the rapid reduction\\nof pressure on the body—oxygen in the lungs is\\nexhaled rapidly. This in effect reduces the partial\\npressure of oxygen in the blood and therefore reduces\\nthe pilot’s effective performance time by one-third to\\none-fourth its normal time. For this reason, the oxygen\\nmask should be worn when flying at very high altitudes\\n(35,000 feet or higher). It is recommended that the\\ncrewmembers select the 100 percent oxygen setting on\\nthe oxygen regulator at high altitude if the airplane is\\nequipped with a demand or pressure demand oxygen\\nsystem.\\nAnother hazard is being tossed or blown out of the\\nairplane if near an opening. For this reason, individuals\\nnear openings should wear safety harnesses or seatbelts\\nat all times when the airplane is pressurized and they\\nare seated.\\nAnother potential hazard during high altitude\\ndecompressions is the possibility of evolved gas\\ndecompression sicknesses. Exposure to wind blasts and\\nextremely cold temperatures are other hazards one\\nmight have to face.\\nRapid descent from altitude is necessary if these\\nproblems are to be minimized. Automatic visual and\\naural warning systems are included in the equipment of\\nall pressurized airplanes.\\nOXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nMost high altitude airplanes come equipped with some\\ntype of fixed oxygen installation. If the airplane does\\nnot have a fixed installation, portable oxygen\\nequipment must be readily accessible during flight. The\\nportable equipment usually consists of a container,\\nregulator, mask outlet, and pressure gauge. Aircraft\\noxygen is usually stored in high pressure system\\ncontainers of 1,800 – 2,200 pounds per square inch\\n(p.s.i.). When the ambient temperature surrounding an\\noxygen cylinder decreases, pressure within that\\ncylinder will decrease because pressure varies directly\\nwith temperature if the volume of a gas remains\\nconstant. If a drop in indicated pressure on a\\nsupplemental oxygen cylinder is noted, there is no\\nreason to suspect depletion of the oxygen supply, which\\nhas simply been compacted due to storage of the\\ncontainers in an unheated area of the aircraft. High\\npressure oxygen containers should be marked with the\\np.s.i. tolerance (i.e., 1,800 p.s.i.) before filling the\\ncontainer to that pressure. The containers should be\\nsupplied with aviation oxygen only, which is 100\\npercent pure oxygen. Industrial oxygen is not intended\\nfor breathing and may contain impurities, and medical\\noxygen contains water vapor that can freeze in the\\nregulator when exposed to cold temperatures. To assure\\nsafety, oxygen system periodic inspection and\\nservicing should be done.\\nAn oxygen system consists of a mask and a regulator\\nthat supplies a flow of oxygen dependent upon cabin\\naltitude. Regulators approved for use up to 40,000 feet\\nare designed to provide zero percent cylinder oxygen\\nand 100 percent cabin air at cabin altitudes of 8,000\\nfeet or less, with the ratio changing to 100 percent\\noxygen and zero percent cabin air at approximately\\n34,000 feet cabin altitude.

Materials that are nearly fireproof in ordinary\\nair may be susceptible to burning in oxygen. Oils and\\ngreases may catch fire if exposed to oxygen, and\\ncannot be used for sealing the valves and fittings of\\noxygen equipment. Smoking during any kind of\\noxygen equipment use is prohibited. Before each flight,\\nthe pilot should thoroughly inspect and test all oxygen\\nequipment. The inspection should include a thorough\\nexamination of the aircraft oxygen equipment,\\nincluding available supply, an operational check of the\\nsystem, and assurance that the supplemental oxygen is\\nreadily accessible. The inspection should be\\naccomplished with clean hands and should include a\\nvisual inspection of the mask and tubing for tears,\\ncracks, or deterioration; the regulator for valve and\\nlever condition and positions; oxygen quantity; and the\\nlocation and functioning of oxygen pressure gauges,\\nflow indicators and connections. The mask should be\\ndonned and the system should be tested. After any\\noxygen use, verify that all components and valves are\\nshut off.\\nMASKS\\nThere are numerous types of oxygen masks in use that\\nvary in design detail. It would be impractical to discuss\\nall of the types in this handbook. It is important that the\\nmasks used be compatible with the particular oxygen\\nsystem involved. Crew masks are fitted to the user’s\\nface with a minimum of leakage. Crew masks usually\\ncontain a microphone. Most masks are the oronasal-\\ntype, which covers only the mouth and nose.\\nPassenger masks may be simple, cup-shaped rubber\\nmoldings sufficiently flexible to obviate individual\\nfitting. They may have a simple elastic head strap or\\nthe passenger may hold them to the face.\\nAll oxygen masks should be kept clean. This reduces\\nthe danger of infection and prolongs the life of the\\nmask. To clean the mask, wash it with a mild soap and\\nwater solution and rinse it with clear water. If a\\nmicrophone is installed, use a clean swab, instead of\\nrunning water, to wipe off the soapy solution. The mask\\nshould also be disinfected. A gauze pad that has been\\nsoaked in a water solution of Merthiolate can be used\\nto swab out the mask. This solution should contain\\none-fifth teaspoon of Merthiolate per quart of water.\\nWipe the mask with a clean cloth and air dry.\\nDILUTER DEMAND OXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nDiluter demand oxygen systems supply oxygen only\\nwhen the user inhales through the mask. An automix\\nlever allows the regulators to automatically mix cabin\\nair and oxygen or supply 100 percent oxygen,\\ndepending on the altitude. The demand mask provides\\na tight seal over the face to prevent dilution with\\noutside air and can be used safely up to 40,000 feet. A\\npilot who has a beard or mustache should be sure it is\\ntrimmed in a manner that will not interfere with the\\nsealing of the oxygen mask. The fit of the mask around\\nthe beard or mustache should be checked on the ground\\nfor proper sealing.\\nPRESSURE DEMAND OXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nPressure demand oxygen systems are similar to diluter\\ndemand oxygen equipment, except that oxygen is\\nsupplied to the mask under pressure at cabin altitudes\\nabove 34,000 feet. Pressure demand regulators also\\ncreate airtight and oxygen-tight seals, but they also\\nprovide a positive pressure application of oxygen to the\\nmask face piece that allows the user’s lungs to be\\npressurized with oxygen. This feature makes pressure\\ndemand regulators safe at altitudes above 40,000 feet.\\nSome systems may have a pressure demand mask with\\nthe regulator attached directly to the mask, rather than\\nmounted on the instrument panel or other area within\\nthe flight deck.

The passenger mask typically has a\\nreservoir bag, which collects oxygen from the\\ncontinuous flow oxygen system during the time when\\nthe mask user is exhaling. The oxygen collected in the\\nreservoir bag allows a higher aspiratory flow rate\\nduring the inhalation cycle, which reduces the amount\\nof air dilution.

Before\\nservicing any aircraft with oxygen, consult the specific\\naircraft service manual to determine the type of\\nequipment required and procedures to be used. Oxygen\\nsystem servicing should be accomplished only when\\nthe aircraft is located outside of the hangars. Personal\\ncleanliness and good housekeeping are imperative\\nwhen working with oxygen. Oxygen under pressure\\nand petroleum products create spontaneous results\\nwhen they are brought in contact with each other.\\nService people should be certain to wash dirt, oil, and\\ngrease (including lip salves and hair oil) from their\\nhands before working around oxygen equipment. It is\\nalso essential that clothing and tools are free of oil,\\ngrease, and dirt. Aircraft with permanently installed\\noxygen tanks usually require two persons to\\naccomplish servicing of the system. One should be\\nstationed at the service equipment control valves, and\\nthe other stationed where he or she can observe the\\naircraft system pressure gauges. Oxygen system\\nservicing is not recommended during aircraft fueling\\noperations or while other work is performed that could\\nprovide a source of ignition. Oxygen system servicing\\nwhile passengers are on board the aircraft is\\nnot recommended.\\nICE CONTROL SYSTEMS\\nIce control systems installed on aircraft consist of\\nanti-ice and de-ice equipment. Anti-icing equipment is\\ndesigned to prevent the formation of ice, while de-icing\\nequipment is designed to remove ice once it has\\nformed. Ice control systems protect the leading edge of\\nwing and tail surfaces, pitot and static port openings,\\nfuel tank vents, stall warning devices, windshields, and\\npropeller blades. Ice detection lighting may also be\\ninstalled on some airplanes to determine the extent of\\nstructural icing during night flights. Since many\\nairplanes are not certified for flight in icing conditions,\\nrefer to the AFM or POH for details.\\nAIRFOIL ICE CONTROL\\nInflatable de-icing boots consist of a rubber sheet\\nbonded to the leading edge of the airfoil. When ice\\nbuilds up on the leading edge, an engine-driven\\npneumatic pump inflates the rubber boots. Some\\nturboprop aircraft divert engine bleed air to the wing to\\ninflate the rubber boots. Upon inflation, the ice is\\ncracked and should fall off the leading edge of the\\nwing. De-icing boots are controlled from the cockpit\\nby a switch and can be operated in a single cycle or\\nallowed to cycle at automatic, timed intervals. It is\\nimportant that de-icing boots are used in accordance\\nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations. If they are\\nallowed to cycle too often, ice can form over the\\ncontour of the boot and render the boots ineffective.\\n[Figure 5-34]\\nMany de-icing boot systems use the instrument system\\nsuction gauge and a pneumatic pressure gauge to\\nindicate proper boot operation. These gauges have\\nrange markings that indicate the operating limits for\\nboot operation. Some systems may also incorporate an\\nannunciator light to indicate proper boot operation.\\nProper maintenance and care of de-icing boots is\\nimportant for continued operation of this system. They\\nneed to be carefully inspected prior to a flight.\\nAnother type of leading edge protection is the thermal\\nanti-ice system installed on airplanes with turbine\\nengines. This system is designed to prevent the buildup\\nof ice by directing hot air from the compressor section\\nof the engine to the leading edge surfaces. The system\\nis activated prior to entering icing conditions. The hot\\nair heats the leading edge sufficiently to prevent the\\nformation of ice.\\nOronasal Mask \\nRebreather Bag\\nFigure 5-33.

The weeping-wing design\\nuses small holes located in the leading edge of the\\nwing. A chemical mixture is pumped to the leading\\nedge and weeps out through the holes to prevent the\\nformation and buildup of ice.\\nWINDSCREEN ICE CONTROL\\nThere are two main types of windscreen anti-ice\\nsystems. The first system directs a flow of alcohol to\\nthe windscreen. By using it early enough, the alcohol\\nwill prevent ice from building up on the windshield.\\nThe rate of alcohol flow can be controlled by a dial in\\nthe cockpit according to procedures recommended by\\nthe airplane manufacturer.\\nAnother effective method of anti-icing equipment is\\nthe electric heating method. Small wires or other\\nconductive material is imbedded in the windscreen.\\nThe heater can be turned on by a switch in the cockpit,\\nat which time electrical current is passed across the\\nshield through the wires to provide sufficient heat to\\nprevent the formation of ice on the windscreen. The\\nelectrical current can cause compass deviation errors;\\nin some cases, as much as 40°. The heated windscreen\\nshould only be used during flight. Do not leave it on\\nduring ground operations, as it can overheat and cause\\ndamage to the windscreen.\\nPROPELLER ICE CONTROL\\nPropellers are protected from icing by use of alcohol or\\nelectrically heated elements. Some propellers are\\nequipped with a discharge nozzle that is pointed toward\\nthe root of the blade. Alcohol is discharged from the\\nnozzles, and centrifugal force makes the alcohol flow\\ndown the leading edge of the blade. This prevents ice\\nfrom forming on the leading edge of the propeller.\\nPropellers can also be fitted with propeller anti-ice\\nboots. The propeller boot is divided into two sections—\\nthe inboard and the outboard sections. The boots are\\ngrooved to help direct the flow of alcohol, and they are\\nalso imbedded with electrical wires that carry current\\nfor heating the propeller. The prop anti-ice system can\\nbe monitored for proper operation by monitoring the\\nprop anti-ice ammeter. During the preflight inspection,\\ncheck the propeller boots for proper operation. If a boot\\nfails to heat one blade, an unequal blade loading can\\nresult, and may cause severe propeller vibration.\\n[Figure 5-35]\\nOTHER ICE CONTROL SYSTEMS\\nPitot and static ports, fuel vents, stall-warning sensors,\\nand other optional equipment may be heated by\\nelectrical elements.

Encounters with structural ice require\\nimmediate remedial action. Anti-icing and de-icing\\nequipment is not intended to sustain long-term flight in\\nicing conditions.\\nTURBINE ENGINES\\nThe turbine engine produces thrust by increasing the\\nvelocity of the air flowing through the engine. It consists\\nof an air inlet, compressor, combustion chambers, tur-\\nbine section, and exhaust.

The compressor types fall into\\nthree categories—centrifugal flow, axial flow, and\\ncentrifugal-axial flow. Compression of inlet air is\\nachieved in a centrifugal flow engine by accelerating\\nair outward perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of\\nthe machine. The axial-flow engine compresses air by\\na series of rotating and stationary airfoils moving the\\nair parallel to the longitudinal axis. The centrifugal-\\naxial flow design uses both kinds of compressors to\\nachieve the desired compression.\\nThe path the air takes through the engine and how\\npower is produced determines the type of engine. There\\nare four types of aircraft turbine engines—turbojet,\\nturboprop, turbofan, and turboshaft.\\nTURBOJET\\nThe turbojet engine contains four sections: compressor,\\ncombustion chamber, turbine section, and exhaust. The\\ncompressor section passes inlet air at a high rate of\\nspeed to the combustion chamber. The combustion\\nchamber contains the fuel inlet and igniter for\\ncombustion. The expanding air drives a turbine, which\\nis connected by a shaft to the compressor, sustaining\\nengine operation. The accelerated exhaust gases from\\nthe engine provide thrust. This is a basic application of\\ncompressing air, igniting the fuel-air mixture,\\nproducing power to self-sustain the engine operation,\\nand exhaust for propulsion.\\nTurbojet engines are limited on range and endurance.\\nThey are also slow to respond to throttle applications at\\nslow compressor speeds.\\nTURBOPROP\\nA turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives a\\npropeller through a reduction gear. The exhaust gases\\ndrive a power turbine connected by a shaft that drives\\nthe reduction gear assembly. Reduction gearing is\\nnecessary in turboprop engines because optimum\\npropeller performance is achieved at much slower\\nspeeds than the engine’s operating r.p.m. Turboprop\\nengines are a compromise between turbojet engines\\nand reciprocating powerplants. Turboprop engines are\\nmost efficient at speeds between 250 and 400 m.p.h.\\nand altitudes between 18,000 and 30,000 feet. They\\nalso perform well at the slow airspeeds required for\\ntakeoff and landing, and are fuel efficient. The mini-\\nmum specific fuel consumption of the turboprop engine\\nis normally available in the altitude range of 25,000\\nfeet to the tropopause.\\nTURBOFAN\\nTurbofans were developed to combine some of the best\\nfeatures of the turbojet and the turboprop. Turbofan\\nengines are designed to create additional thrust by\\ndiverting a secondary airflow around the combustion\\nchamber. The turbofan bypass air generates increased\\nthrust, cools the engine, and aids in exhaust noise\\nsuppression. This provides turbojet-type cruise speed\\nand lower fuel consumption.\\nThe inlet air that passes through a turbofan engine is\\nusually divided into two separate streams of air. One\\nstream passes through the engine core, while a second\\nstream bypasses the engine core. It is this bypass\\nstream of air that is responsible for the term “bypass\\nengine.” A turbofan’s bypass ratio refers to the ratio of\\nthe mass airflow that passes through the fan divided by\\nthe mass airflow that passes through the engine core.\\nFigure 5-36.

The biggest difference between a\\nturbojet and turboshaft engine is that on a turboshaft\\nengine, most of the energy produced by the expanding\\ngases is used to drive a turbine rather than produce\\nthrust. Many helicopters use a turboshaft gas turbine\\nengine. In addition, turboshaft engines are widely used\\nas auxiliary power units on large aircraft.\\nPERFORMANCE COMPARISON\\nIt is possible to compare the performance of a\\nreciprocating powerplant and different types of turbine\\nengines. However, for the comparison to be accurate,\\nthrust horsepower (usable horsepower) for the\\nreciprocating powerplant must be used rather than\\nbrake horsepower, and net thrust must be used for the\\nturbine-powered engines. In addition, aircraft design\\nconfiguration, and size must be approximately\\nthe same.\\nBHP— Brake horsepower is the horsepower \\nactually delivered to the output shaft. \\nBrake horsepower is the actual usable \\nhorsepower.\\nNet Thrust— The thrust produced by a turbojet or\\nturbofan engine.\\nTHP— Thrust horsepower is the horsepower\\nequivalent of the thrust produced by a \\nturbojet or turbofan engine.\\nESHP— Equivalent shaft horsepower, with \\nrespect to turboprop engines, is the \\nsum of the shaft horsepower (SHP) \\ndelivered to the propeller and the \\nthrust horsepower (THP) produced by\\nthe exhaust gases.\\nFigure 5-37 shows how four types of engines compare\\nin net thrust as airspeed is increased. This figure is for\\nexplanatory purposes only and is not for specific\\nmodels of engines. The four types of engines are:\\n• Reciprocating powerplant.\\n• Turbine, propeller combination (turboprop).\\n• Turbine engine incorporating a fan (turbofan).\\n• Turbojet (pure jet).\\nThe comparison is made by plotting the performance\\ncurve for each engine, which shows how maximum\\naircraft speed varies with the type of engine used. Since\\nthe graph is only a means of comparison, numerical\\nvalues for net thrust, aircraft speed, and drag are\\nnot included.\\nComparison of the four powerplants on the basis of net\\nthrust makes certain performance capabilities evident.\\nIn the speed range shown to the left of Line A, the\\nreciprocating powerplant outperforms the other three\\ntypes. The turboprop outperforms the turbofan in the\\nrange to the left of Line C. The turbofan engine\\noutperforms the turbojet in the range to the left of Line\\nF. The turbofan engine outperforms the reciprocating\\npowerplant to the right of Line B and the turboprop to\\nthe right of Line C. The turbojet outperforms the\\nreciprocating powerplant to the right of Line D, the\\nturboprop to the right of Line E, and the turbofan to the\\nright of Line F.\\nThe points where the aircraft drag curve intersects the\\nnet thrust curves are the maximum aircraft speeds. The\\nvertical lines from each of the points to the baseline of\\nthe graph indicate that the turbojet aircraft can attain a\\nhigher maximum speed than aircraft equipped with the\\nother types of engines. Aircraft equipped with the\\nturbofan engine will attain a higher maximum\\nspeed than aircraft equipped with a turboprop or\\nreciprocating powerplant.\\nTURBINE ENGINE INSTRUMENTS\\nEngine instruments that indicate oil pressure, oil temper-\\nature, engine speed, exhaust gas temperature, and fuel\\nflow are common to both turbine and reciprocating\\nengines. However, there are some instruments that are\\nunique to turbine engines. These instruments provide\\nindications of engine pressure ratio, turbine discharge\\npressure, and torque. In addition, most gas turbine\\nengines have multiple temperature-sensing instruments,\\ncalled thermocouples, that provide pilots with\\ntemperature readings in and around the turbine section.\\nAircraft Drag\\nAirspeed\\nNet Thrust\\nA\\nC\\nB\\nD\\nE F\\nTurbojet\\nTurbofan\\nTurboprop\\nReciprocating\\nFigure 5-37.

Pressure measurements are recorded by\\nprobes installed in the engine inlet and at the exhaust.\\nOnce collected, the data is sent to a differential\\npressure transducer, which is indicated on a cockpit\\nEPR gauge.\\nEPR system design automatically compensates for the\\neffects of airspeed and altitude. However, changes in\\nambient temperature do require a correction to be\\napplied to EPR indications to provide accurate engine\\npower settings.\\nEXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE\\nA limiting factor in a gas turbine engine is the\\ntemperature of the turbine section. The temperature of\\na turbine section must be monitored closely to prevent\\noverheating the turbine blades and other exhaust\\nsection components. One common way of monitoring\\nthe temperature of a turbine section is with an exhaust\\ngas temperature (EGT) gauge. EGT is an engine\\noperating limit used to monitor overall engine\\noperating conditions.\\nVariations of EGT systems bear different names based\\non the location of the temperature sensors. Common tur-\\nbine temperature sensing gauges include the turbine inlet\\ntemperature (TIT) gauge, turbine outlet temperature\\n(TOT) gauge, interstage turbine temperature (ITT)\\ngauge, and turbine gas temperature (TGT) gauge.\\nTORQUEMETER\\nTurboprop/turboshaft engine power output is measured\\nby the torquemeter. Torque is a twisting force applied\\nto a shaft. The torquemeter measures power applied to\\nthe shaft. Turboprop and turboshaft engines are\\ndesigned to produce torque for driving a propeller.\\nTorquemeters are calibrated in percentage units,\\nfoot-pounds, or pounds per square inch.\\nN1 INDICATOR\\nN1 represents the rotational speed of the low pressure\\ncompressor and is presented on the indicator as a\\npercentage of design r.p.m. After start the speed of the\\nlow pressure compressor is governed by the N\\n1 turbine\\nwheel. The N 1 turbine wheel is connected to the low\\npressure compressor through a concentric shaft.\\nN2 INDICATOR\\nN2 represents the rotational speed of the high pressure\\ncompressor and is presented on the indicator as a\\npercentage of design r.p.m. The high pressure\\ncompressor is governed by the N\\n2 turbine wheel. The\\nN2 turbine wheel is connected to the high pressure\\ncompressor through a concentric shaft. [Figure 5-38]\\nTURBINE ENGINE OPERATIONAL\\nCONSIDERATIONS\\nBecause of the great variety of turbine engines, it is\\nimpractical to cover specific operational procedures.\\nHowever, there are certain operational considerations\\nthat are common to all turbine engines. They are engine\\ntemperature limits, foreign object damage, hot start,\\ncompressor stall, and flameout.\\nENGINE TEMPERATURE LIMITATIONS\\nThe highest temperature in any turbine engine occurs\\nat the turbine inlet. Turbine inlet temperature is\\ntherefore usually the limiting factor in turbine\\nengine operation.\\nTHRUST VARIATIONS\\nTurbine engine thrust varies directly with air density.\\nAs air density decreases, so does thrust. While both\\nturbine and reciprocating powered engines are affected\\nto some degree by high relative humidity, turbine\\nengines will experience a negligible loss of thrust,\\nwhile reciprocating engines a significant loss of brake\\nhorsepower.\\nFOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE\\nDue to the design and function of a turbine engine’s air\\ninlet, the possibility of ingestion of debris always\\nexists. This causes significant damage, particularly to\\nthe compressor and turbine sections. When this occurs,\\nit is called foreign object damage (FOD). Typical FOD\\nconsists of small nicks and dents caused by ingestion\\nof small objects from the ramp, taxiway, or runway.\\nHowever, FOD damage caused by bird strikes or ice\\ningestion can also occur, and may result in total\\ndestruction of an engine.\\nPrevention of FOD is a high priority. Some engine\\ninlets have a tendency to form a vortex between the\\nground and the inlet during ground operations. A\\nvortex dissipater may be installed on these engines.\\nConcentric Shaft—One shaft inside another shaft having a common core.\\nLow Pressure\\nCompressor (N1)\\nHigh Pressure\\nCompressor\\nDrive Shaft\\nHigh Pressure\\nCompressor (N\\n2)\\nLow Pressure\\nCompressor\\nDrive Shaft\\nFigure 5-38.

Preflight procedures include a visual\\ninspection for any sign of FOD.\\nTURBINE ENGINE HOT/HUNG START\\nA hot start is when the EGT exceeds the safe limit. Hot\\nstarts are caused by too much fuel entering the\\ncombustion chamber, or insufficient turbine r.p.m. Any\\ntime an engine has a hot start, refer to the AFM, POH,\\nor an appropriate maintenance manual for inspection\\nrequirements.\\nIf the engine fails to accelerate to the proper speed after\\nignition or does not accelerate to idle r.p.m., a hung\\nstart has occurred. A hung start, may also be called a\\nfalse start. A hung start may be caused by an\\ninsufficient starting power source or fuel control\\nmalfunction.\\nCOMPRESSOR STALLS\\nCompressor blades are small airfoils and are subject to\\nthe same aerodynamic principles that apply to any\\nairfoil. A compressor blade has an angle of attack. The\\nangle of attack is a result of inlet air velocity and the\\ncompressor’s rotational velocity. These two forces\\ncombine to form a vector, which defines the airfoil’s\\nactual angle of attack to the approaching inlet air.\\nA compressor stall can be described as an imbalance\\nbetween the two vector quantities, inlet velocity and\\ncompressor rotational speed. Compressor stalls occur\\nwhen the compressor blades’ angle of attack exceeds\\nthe critical angle of attack. At this point, smooth\\nairflow is interrupted and turbulence is created with\\npressure fluctuations. Compressor stalls cause air\\nflowing in the compressor to slow down and stagnate,\\nsometimes reversing direction. [Figure 5-39]\\nCompressor stalls can be transient and\\nintermittent or steady state and severe. Indications of a\\ntransient/intermittent stall are usually an intermittent\\n“bang” as backfire and flow reversal take place. If the\\nstall develops and becomes steady, strong vibration and\\na loud roar may develop from the continuous flow\\nreversal. Quite often the cockpit gauges will not show a\\nmild or transient stall, but will indicate a developed\\nstall. Typical instrument indications include\\nfluctuations in r.p.m., and an increase in exhaust gas\\ntemperature. Most transient stalls are not harmful to the\\nengine and often correct themselves after one or two\\npulsations. The possibility of engine damage, which\\nmay be severe, from a steady state stall is immediate.\\nRecovery must be accomplished quickly by reducing\\npower, decreasing the airplane’s angle of attack and\\nincreasing airspeed.\\nAlthough all gas turbine engines are subject to\\ncompressor stalls, most models have systems that\\ninhibit these stalls. One such system uses variable inlet\\nguide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vanes, which\\ndirect the incoming air into the rotor blades at an\\nappropriate angle. The main way to prevent air\\npressure stalls is to operate the airplane within the\\nparameters established by the manufacturer. If a\\ncompressor stall does develop, follow the procedures\\nrecommended in the AFM or POH.\\nFLAMEOUT\\nA flameout is a condition in the operation of a gas\\nturbine engine in which the fire in the engine\\nunintentionally goes out. If the rich limit of the fuel/air\\nratio is exceeded in the combustion chamber, the flame\\nwill blow out. This condition is often referred to as a\\nrich flameout. It generally results from very fast engine\\nacceleration, where an overly rich mixture causes the\\nfuel temperature to drop below the combustion\\ntemperature. It also may be caused by insufficient\\nairflow to support combustion.\\nAnother, more common flameout occurrence is due to\\nlow fuel pressure and low engine speeds, which\\ntypically are associated with high-altitude flight. This\\nsituation also may occur with the engine throttled back\\nduring a descent, which can set up the lean-condition\\nflameout. A weak mixture can easily cause the flame to\\ndie out, even with a normal airflow through the engine.\\nAny interruption of the fuel supply also can result in a\\nflameout. This may be due to prolonged unusual\\nattitudes, a malfunctioning fuel control system,\\nturbulence, icing or running out of fuel.\\nSymptoms of a flameout normally are the same as\\nthose following an engine failure. If the flameout is due\\nto a transitory condition, such as an imbalance between\\nfuel flow and engine speed, an airstart may be\\nNormal Inlet\\nAirflow\\nDistorted Inlet\\nAirflow\\nFigure 5-39.

This chapter covers the operational aspects of\\nthe pitot-static system and associated instruments, the\\nvacuum system and associated instruments, and the\\nmagnetic compass. \\nPITOT-STATIC FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS\\nThere are two major parts of the pitot-static system: the\\nimpact pressure chamber and lines, and the static \\npressure chamber and lines. They provide the source of\\nambient air pressure for the operation of the \\naltimeter, vertical speed indicator (vertical velocity\\nindicator), and the airspeed indicator.  [Figure 6-1]\\nIMPACT PRESSURE CHAMBER AND LINES\\nIn this system, the impact air pressure (air striking the\\nairplane because of its forward motion) is taken from a\\npitot tube, which is mounted in locations that provide \\nminimum disturbance or turbulence caused by \\nthe motion of the airplane through the air. The static\\npressure (pressure of the still air) is usually taken from\\nthe static line attached to a vent or vents mounted flush\\nwith the side of the fuselage. This compensates for any\\npossible variation in static pressure due to erratic\\nchanges in airplane attitude. \\nThe openings of both the pitot tube and the static vent\\nmust be checked during the preflight inspection to\\nassure that they are free from obstructions. Blocked \\nor partially blocked openings should be cleaned by \\na certificated mechanic. Blowing into these openings is\\nnot recommended because this could damage the\\ninstruments.\\nAs the airplane moves through the air, the impact \\npressure on the open pitot tube affects the pressure in\\nthe pitot chamber. Any change of pressure in the pitot\\nchamber is transmitted through a line connected to the\\nairspeed indicator, which utilizes impact pressure for\\nits operation. \\nSTATIC PRESSURE CHAMBER AND LINES\\nThe static chamber is vented through small holes to \\nthe free undisturbed air, and as the atmospheric \\npressure increases or decreases, the pressure in \\nthe static chamber changes accordingly. Again, this\\npressure change is transmitted through lines to the\\ninstruments which utilize static pressure.\\nPitot\\nHeater Switch\\nPitot\\nTube\\nAirspeed\\nIndicator\\nVertical\\nSpeed\\nIndicator\\n(VSI) Altimeter\\nDrain\\nOpening\\nStatic Port\\nON\\nOFF\\nAlternate Static Source\\nALT\\nSTATIC AIR\\nPULL ONPressure\\nChamber\\nFigure 6-1.

This source usually is vented to the pressure\\ninside the cockpit. Because of the venturi effect of \\nthe flow of air over the cockpit, this alternate static\\npressure is usually lower than the pressure provided \\nby the normal static air source. When the alternate\\nstatic source is used, the following differences in the\\ninstrument indications usually occur: the altimeter will\\nindicate higher than the actual altitude, the airspeed\\nwill indicate greater than the actual airspeed, and the\\nvertical speed will indicate a climb while in level flight.\\nConsult the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nOperating Handbook (AFM/POH) to determine the\\namount of error.\\nIf the airplane is not equipped with an alternate static\\nsource, breaking the glass seal of the vertical speed\\nindicator allows ambient air pressure to enter the static\\nsystem. This makes the VSI unusable.\\nALTIMETER\\nThe altimeter measures the height of the airplane above\\na given pressure level. Since it is the only instrument\\nthat gives altitude information, the altimeter is one\\nof the most vital instruments in the airplane. To use\\nthe altimeter effectively, its operation and how\\natmospheric pressure and temperature affect it must\\nbe thoroughly understood. A stack of sealed aneroid\\nwafers comprises the main component of the altime-\\nter. These wafers expand and contract with changes\\nin atmospheric pressure from the static source. The\\nmechanical linkage translates these changes into\\npointer movements on the indicator. [Figure 6-2]\\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\\nThe pressure altimeter is an aneroid barometer that\\nmeasures the pressure of the atmosphere at the level\\nwhere the altimeter is located, and presents an altitude\\nindication in feet. The altimeter uses static pressure as\\nits source of operation. Air is denser at sea level than\\naloft, so as altitude increases, atmospheric pressure\\ndecreases. This difference in pressure at various levels\\ncauses the altimeter to indicate changes in altitude.\\nThe presentation of altitude varies considerably\\nbetween different types of altimeters. Some have \\none pointer while others have two or more. Only the\\nmultipointer type will be discussed in this handbook.\\nThe dial of a typical altimeter is graduated with numer-\\nals arranged clockwise from 0 to 9. Movement of the\\naneroid element is transmitted through gears to \\nthe three hands that indicate altitude. The shortest \\nhand indicates altitude in tens of thousands of feet; the\\nintermediate hand in thousands of feet; and the longest\\nhand in hundreds of feet.\\nThis indicated altitude is correct, however, only when\\nthe sea level barometric pressure is standard (29.92\\ninches of mercury), the sea level free air temperature is\\nstandard (+15°C or 59°F), and the pressure and \\ntemperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase\\nin altitude. Adjustments for nonstandard conditions are\\naccomplished by setting the corrected pressure into a \\nbarometric scale located on the face of the altimeter.\\nOnly after the altimeter is set does it indicate the \\ncorrect altitude.\\nEFFECT OF NONSTANDARD PRESSURE \\nAND TEMPERATURE\\nIf no means were provided for adjusting altimeters to\\nnonstandard pressure, flight could be hazardous. For\\nexample, if flying from a high-pressure area to a \\nlow-pressure area without adjusting the altimeter, the\\nactual altitude of the airplane would be LOWER than\\nthe indicated altitude. An old saying, “HIGH TO LOW,\\nLOOK OUT BELOW” is a way of remembering which\\ncondition is dangerous. When flying from a low-pres-\\nsure area to a high-pressure area without adjusting the\\naltimeter, the actual altitude of the airplane is HIGHER\\nthan the indicated altitude.\\nFigure 6-3 shows how variations in air temperature also\\naffect the altimeter. On a warm day, a given mass of air\\nexpands to a larger volume than on a cold day, raising\\nthe pressure levels. For example, the pressure level\\nwhere the altimeter indicates 5,000 feet is HIGHER on\\na warm day than under standard conditions. On a cold\\nday, the reverse is true, and the pressure level where the\\naltimeter indicates 5,000 feet is LOWER.\\nThe adjustment to compensate for nonstandard pres-\\nsure does not compensate for nonstandard temperature.\\nAneroid\\nWafers\\nAltimeter\\nSetting Window\\nAltitude\\nIndication\\nScale\\n10,000 ft\\n  Pointer\\n1,000 ft\\nPointer\\n100 ft Pointer\\nAltimeter Setting \\nAdjustment Knob\\nCrosshatch\\nFlag\\nA crosshatched\\narea appears\\non some altimeters\\nwhen displaying\\nan altitude below\\n10,000 feet MSL.\\nStatic Port\\nFigure 6-2.

Modify the memory aid to “HIGH TO LOW\\nOR HOT TO COLD, LOOK OUT BELOW.”\\nSETTING THE ALTIMETER\\nMost altimeters are equipped with a barometric \\npressure setting window (sometimes referred to as the\\nKollsman window) providing a means to adjust the\\naltimeter. A knob is located at the bottom of the instru-\\nment for this adjustment. \\nTo adjust the altimeter for variation in atmospheric\\npressure, the pressure scale in the altimeter setting \\nwindow, calibrated in inches of mercury (in. Hg) and/or\\nmillibars (Mb), is adjusted to match the given altimeter\\nsetting. Altimeter setting is defined as station pressure\\nreduced to sea level. However, an altimeter setting is\\naccurate only in the vicinity of the reporting station.\\nTherefore, the altimeter must be adjusted as the flight\\nprogresses from one station to the next.\\nMany pilots confidently expect that the current altimeter\\nsetting will compensate for irregularities in atmospheric\\npressure at all altitudes, but this is not always true. The\\naltimeter setting broadcast by ground stations is the \\nstation pressure corrected to mean sea level. It does not\\naccount for the irregularities at higher levels, particu-\\nlarly the effect of nonstandard temperature. However, if\\neach pilot in a given area is using the same altimeter \\nsetting, each altimeter should be equally affected by \\ntemperature and pressure variation errors, making it \\npossible to maintain the desired vertical separation\\nbetween aircraft.\\nWhen flying over high, mountainous terrain, certain\\natmospheric conditions can cause the altimeter to \\nindicate an altitude of 1,000 feet, or more, HIGHER\\nthan the actual altitude. For this reason, a generous\\nmargin of altitude should be allowed—not only \\nfor possible altimeter error, but also for possible \\ndowndrafts that might be associated with high winds.\\nTo illustrate the use of the altimeter setting system, \\nfollow a flight from Dallas Love Field, Texas to\\nAbilene Municipal Airport, Texas via Mineral Wells.\\nBefore taking off from Love Field, the pilot receives a\\ncurrent altimeter setting of 29.85 from the control\\ntower or automatic terminal information service\\n(ATIS), and sets this value in the altimeter setting \\n   5,000-foot pressure level\\n   4,000-foot pressure level\\n   3,000-foot pressure level\\n   2,000-foot pressure level\\n   1,000-foot pressure level\\n   Sea level\\n 30°C                                   15°C                                      0°C\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nFigure 6-3.

The altimeter indication should then be \\ncompared with the known airport elevation of 487 feet.\\nSince most altimeters are not perfectly calibrated, an\\nerror may exist. \\nWhen over Mineral Wells, assume the pilot receives a\\ncurrent altimeter setting of 29.94 and sets this in the\\naltimeter window. Before entering the traffic pattern at\\nAbilene Municipal Airport, a new altimeter setting of\\n29.69 is received from the Abilene Control Tower, and\\nset in the altimeter setting window. If the pilot desires\\nto fly the traffic pattern at approximately 800 feet\\nabove the terrain, and the field elevation of Abilene is\\n1,791 feet, an indicated altitude of 2,600 feet should be\\nmaintained (1,791 feet + 800 feet = 2,591 feet rounded\\nto 2,600 feet).\\nThe importance of properly setting the altimeter cannot\\nbe overemphasized. Assume that the pilot did not\\nadjust the altimeter at Abilene to the current setting,\\nand continued using the Mineral Wells setting of 29.94.\\nWhen entering the Abilene traffic pattern at an \\nindicated altitude of 2,600 feet, the airplane would be\\napproximately 250 feet below the proper traffic pattern\\naltitude. Upon landing, the altimeter would indicate\\napproximately 250 feet higher than the field elevation.\\nAltimeter setting 29.94\\nCurrent altimeter setting 29.69\\nDifference .25\\n(Since 1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately\\n1,000 feet of altitude, .25 �1,000 feet = 250 feet.)\\nWhen determining whether to add or subtract the\\namount of altimeter error, remember that, when the\\nactual pressure is lower than what is set in the altimeter\\nwindow, the actual altitude of the airplane will be lower\\nthan what is indicated on the altimeter. \\nALTIMETER OPERATION\\nThere are two means by which the altimeter pointers\\ncan be moved. The first is a change in air pressure,\\nwhile the other is an adjustment to the barometric \\nscale. When the airplane climbs or descends, changing\\npressure within the altimeter case expands or contracts\\nthe aneroid barometer. This movement is transmitted\\nthrough mechanical linkage to rotate the pointers. A\\ndecrease in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate an\\nincrease in altitude, and an increase in pressure causes\\nthe altimeter to indicate a decrease in altitude.\\nAccordingly, if the airplane is flown from a pressure\\nlevel of 28.75 in. Hg. to a pressure level of 29.75 \\nin. Hg., the altimeter would show a decrease of \\napproximately 1,000 feet in altitude.\\nThe other method of moving the pointers does not\\nrely on changing air pressure, but the mechanical\\nconstruction of the altimeter. Do not be confused by\\nthe fact that as the barometric pressure scale is\\nmoved, the indicator needles move in the same\\ndirection, which is opposite to the reaction the\\npointers have when air pressure changes. To illus-\\ntrate this point, suppose the pilot lands at an airport\\nwith an elevation of 1,000 feet and the altimeter is\\ncorrectly set to the current sea level pressure of\\n30.00 in. Hg. While the airplane is parked on the\\nramp, the pressure decreases to 29.50. The altimeter\\nsenses this as a climb and now indicates 1,500 feet.\\nWhen returning to the airplane, if the setting in the\\naltimeter window is decreased to the current sea\\nlevel pressure of 29.50, the indication will be\\nreduced back down to 1,000 feet. \\nKnowing the airplane’s altitude is vitally important\\nto a pilot. The pilot must be sure that the airplane is\\nflying high enough to clear the highest terrain or\\nobstruction along the intended route. It is especially\\nimportant to have accurate altitude information when\\nvisibility is restricted. To clear obstructions, the pilot\\nmust constantly be aware of the altitude of the air-\\nplane and the elevation of the surrounding terrain. To\\nreduce the possibility of a midair collision, it is\\nessential to maintain altitude in accordance with air\\ntraffic rules.\\nTYPES OF ALTITUDE \\nAltitude is vertical distance above some point or level\\nused as a reference. There are as many kinds of altitude\\nas there are reference levels from which altitude is\\nmeasured, and each may be used for specific reasons.\\nPilots are mainly concerned with five types of altitudes:\\nIndicated Altitude— That altitude read directly from\\nthe altimeter (uncorrected) when it is set to the current\\naltimeter setting.\\nTrue Altitude— The vertical distance of the airplane\\nabove sea level—the actual altitude. It is often\\nexpressed as feet above mean sea level (MSL). Airport,\\nterrain, and obstacle elevations on aeronautical charts\\nare true altitudes.\\nAbsolute Altitude— The vertical distance of an air-\\nplane above the terrain, or above ground level (AGL).\\nPressure Altitude— The altitude indicated when the\\naltimeter setting window (barometric scale) is adjusted\\nto 29.92.

Hg. Pressure \\naltitude is used to compute density altitude, true \\naltitude, true airspeed, and other performance data.\\nDensity Altitude— This altitude is pressure altitude\\ncorrected for variations from standard temperature.\\nWhen conditions are standard, pressure altitude and\\ndensity altitude are the same. If the temperature is\\nabove standard, the density altitude is higher than \\npressure altitude. If the temperature is below standard,\\nthe density altitude is lower than pressure altitude. This\\nis an important altitude because it is directly related to\\nthe airplane’s performance.\\nAs an example, consider an airport with a field \\nelevation of 5,048 feet MSL where the standard \\ntemperature is 5°C. Under these conditions, pressure\\naltitude and density altitude are the same—5,048 feet.\\nIf the temperature changes to 30°C, the density \\naltitude increases to 7,855 feet. This means an airplane\\nwould perform on takeoff as though the field elevation\\nwere 7,855 feet at standard temperature. Conversely, a\\ntemperature of -25°C would result in a density altitude\\nof 1,232 feet. An airplane would have much better \\nperformance under these conditions.\\nInstrument Check— To determine the condition of \\nan altimeter, set the barometric scale to the altimeter\\nsetting transmitted by the local automated flight \\nservice station (AFSS) or any other reliable source. The\\naltimeter pointers should indicate the surveyed eleva-\\ntion of the airport. If the indication is off more than 75\\nfeet from the surveyed elevation, the instrument\\nshould be referred to a certificated instrument repair\\nstation for recalibration.\\nVERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR\\nThe vertical speed indicator (VSI), which is sometimes\\ncalled a vertical velocity indicator (VVI), indicates\\nwhether the airplane is climbing, descending, or in level\\nflight. The rate of climb or descent is indicated in feet\\nper minute. If properly calibrated, the VSI indicates zero\\nin level flight. [Figure 6-4]\\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\\nAlthough the vertical speed indicator operates solely\\nfrom static pressure, it is a differential pressure \\ninstrument. It contains a diaphragm with connecting\\nlinkage and gearing to the indicator pointer inside an\\nairtight case. The inside of the diaphragm is connected\\ndirectly to the static line of the pitot-static system. \\nThe area outside the diaphragm, which is inside the\\ninstrument case, is also connected to the static line, but\\nthrough a restricted orifice (calibrated leak).\\nBoth the diaphragm and the case receive air from the\\nstatic line at existing atmospheric pressure. When the\\nairplane is on the ground or in level flight, the pressures\\ninside the diaphragm and the instrument case remain\\nthe same and the pointer is at the zero indication. When\\nthe airplane climbs or descends, the pressure inside \\nthe diaphragm changes immediately, but due to the\\nmetering action of the restricted passage, the case \\npressure remains higher or lower for a short time, \\ncausing the diaphragm to contract or expand. This\\ncauses a pressure differential that is indicated on the\\ninstrument needle as a climb or descent. When the \\npressure differential stabilizes at a definite ratio, the\\nneedle indicates the rate of altitude change. \\nThe vertical speed indicator is capable of displaying\\ntwo different types of information:\\n• Trend information shows an immediate indica-\\ntion of an increase or decrease in the airplane’s\\nrate of climb or descent.\\n• Rate information shows a stabilized rate of\\nchange in altitude.\\nFor example, if maintaining a steady 500-foot per\\nminute (f.p.m.) climb, and the nose is lowered\\nslightly, the VSI immediately senses this change and\\nindicates a decrease in the rate of climb. This first\\nindication is called the trend. After a short time, the\\nVSI needle stabilizes on the new rate of climb, which\\nin this example, is something less than 500 f.p.m. The\\ntime from the initial change in the rate of climb, until\\nthe VSI displays an accurate indication of the new\\nrate, is called the lag. Rough control technique and\\nturbulence can extend the lag period and cause erratic\\nand unstable rate indications.

These two pressures will be equal when the \\nairplane is parked on the ground in calm air. When \\nthe airplane moves through the air, the pressure on the\\npitot line becomes greater than the pressure in the static\\nlines. This difference in pressure is registered by the\\nairspeed pointer on the face of the instrument,\\nwhich is calibrated in miles per hour, knots, or both.\\n[Figure 6-6]\\nPilots should understand the following speeds:\\nIndicated Airspeed (IAS)— The direct instrument\\nreading obtained from the airspeed indicator, \\nuncorrected for variations in atmospheric density,\\ninstallation error, or instrument error. Manufacturers\\nuse this airspeed as the basis for determining airplane\\nperformance. Takeoff, landing, and stall speeds listed\\nin the AFM or POH are indicated airspeeds and do not\\nnormally vary with altitude or temperature.\\nCalibrated Airspeed (CAS)— Indicated airspeed \\ncorrected for installation error and instrument error.\\nAlthough manufacturers attempt to keep airspeed\\nerrors to a minimum, it is not possible to eliminate \\nall errors throughout the airspeed operating range. At\\ncertain airspeeds and with certain flap settings, the\\ninstallation and instrument errors may total several\\nknots. This error is generally greatest at low airspeeds.\\nIn the cruising and higher airspeed ranges, indicated\\nairspeed and calibrated airspeed are approximately the\\nsame. Refer to the airspeed calibration chart to correct\\nfor possible airspeed errors. \\nTrue Airspeed (TAS)—Calibrated airspeed corrected\\nfor altitude and nonstandard temperature. Because air\\ndensity decreases with an increase in altitude, an \\nairplane has to be flown faster at higher altitudes to\\ncause the same pressure difference between pitot\\nimpact pressure and static pressure. Therefore, for a\\ngiven calibrated airspeed, true airspeed increases as\\naltitude increases; or for a given true airspeed, \\ncalibrated airspeed decreases as altitude increases.\\nA pilot can find true airspeed by two methods. The\\nmost accurate method is to use a flight computer. With\\nthis method, the calibrated airspeed is corrected \\nfor temperature and pressure variation by using the \\nairspeed correction scale on the computer. Extremely\\naccurate electronic flight computers are also available.\\nJust enter the CAS, pressure altitude, and temperature\\nand the computer calculates the true airspeed.\\nA second method, which is a “rule of thumb,” will \\nprovide the approximate true airspeed. Simply add 2 \\npercent to the calibrated airspeed for each 1,000 feet of\\naltitude.\\nGroundspeed (GS)— The actual speed of the airplane\\nover the ground. It is true airspeed adjusted for wind.\\nGroundspeed decreases with a headwind, and increases\\nwith a tailwind.\\nAIRSPEED INDICATOR MARKINGS\\nAirplanes weighing 12,500 pounds or less, manufac-\\ntured after 1945, and certificated by the FAA, \\nare required to have airspeed indicators marked in\\naccordance with a standard color-coded marking \\nKnots—Nautical miles per hour.\\nDiaphragm\\nStatic Air Line\\nRam Air\\nPitot Tube\\nFigure 6-6.

This system of color-coded markings enables\\na pilot to determine at a glance certain airspeed limi-\\ntations that are important to the safe operation of the\\nairplane. For example, if during the execution of a\\nmaneuver, it is noted that the airspeed needle is in the\\nyellow arc and rapidly approaching the red line, the\\nimmediate reaction should be to reduce airspeed. \\nAs shown in figure 6-7, airspeed indicators on single-\\nengine small airplanes include the following standard\\ncolor-coded markings:\\n• White arc—This arc is commonly referred to \\nas the flap operating range since its lower limit\\nrepresents the full flap stall speed and its upper\\nlimit provides the maximum flap speed.\\nApproaches and landings are usually flown at\\nspeeds within the white arc.\\n• Lower limit of white arc (V\\nS0)—The stalling\\nspeed or the minimum steady flight speed in the\\nlanding configuration. In small airplanes, this is\\nthe power-off stall speed at the maximum landing\\nweight in the landing configuration (gear and\\nflaps down).\\n• Upper limit of the white arc (V\\nFE)—The maxi-\\nmum speed with the flaps extended.\\n• Green arc—This is the normal operating range of\\nthe airplane. Most flying occurs within this range.\\n• Lower limit of green arc (V S1)—The stalling\\nspeed or the minimum steady flight speed\\nobtained in a specified configuration. For most\\nairplanes, this is the power-off stall speed at the\\nmaximum takeoff weight in the clean configuration\\n(gear up, if retractable, and flaps up). \\n• Upper limit of green arc (V NO)—The maximum\\nstructural cruising speed. Do not exceed this\\nspeed except in smooth air.\\n• Yellow arc—Caution range. Fly within this range\\nonly in smooth air, and then, only with caution.\\n• Red line (V\\nNE)—Never-exceed speed. Operating\\nabove this speed is prohibited since it may result\\nin damage or structural failure.\\nOTHER AIRSPEED LIMITATIONS\\nSome important airspeed limitations are not marked on the\\nface of the airspeed indicator, but are found on placards\\nand in the AFM or POH. These airspeeds include:\\n• Design maneuvering speed (V\\nA)—This is the\\n“rough air” speed and the maximum speed for abrupt\\nmaneuvers. If during flight, rough air or severe \\nturbulence is encountered, reduce the airspeed to\\nmaneuvering speed or less to minimize stress on the\\nairplane structure. It is important to consider weight\\nwhen referencing this speed. For example, V\\nA may\\nbe 100 knots when an airplane is heavily loaded, but\\nonly 90 knots when the load is light.\\n• Landing gear operating speed (V\\nLO)—The\\nmaximum speed for extending or retracting the\\nlanding gear if using an airplane equipped with\\nretractable landing gear.\\n• Landing gear extended speed (V\\nLE)—The\\nmaximum speed at which an airplane can be\\nsafely flown with the landing gear extended. \\n• Best angle-of-climb speed (V\\nX)—The airspeed at\\nwhich an airplane gains the greatest amount of\\naltitude in a given distance. It is used during a\\nshort-field takeoff to clear an obstacle.\\n• Best rate-of-climb speed (V\\nY)—This airspeed\\nprovides the most altitude gain in a given period\\nof time. \\n• Minimum control speed (V\\nMC)—This is the min-\\nimum flight speed at which a light, twin-engine\\nairplane can be satisfactorily controlled when an\\nengine suddenly becomes inoperative and the\\nremaining engine is at takeoff power.\\n• Best rate of climb with one engine inoperative\\n(V\\nYSE)—This airspeed provides the most altitude\\ngain in a given period of time in a light, twin-\\nengine airplane following an engine failure.\\nInstrument Check— Prior to takeoff, the airspeed\\nindicator should read zero.

Blockage may be caused by\\nmoisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. During pre-\\nflight, make sure the pitot tube cover is removed. Then,\\ncheck the pitot and static port openings. A blocked pitot\\ntube affects the accuracy of only the airspeed indicator.\\nHowever, a blockage of the static system not only affects\\nthe airspeed indicator, but can also cause errors in the\\naltimeter and vertical speed indicator.\\nBLOCKED PITOT SYSTEM \\nThe pitot system can become blocked completely or\\nonly partially if the pitot tube drain hole remains open.\\nIf the pitot tube becomes blocked and its associated\\ndrain hole remains clear, ram air no longer is able to\\nenter the pitot system. Air already in the system will\\nvent through the drain hole, and the remaining pressure\\nwill drop to ambient (outside) air pressure. Under these\\ncircumstances, the airspeed indicator reading decreases\\nto zero, because the airspeed indicator senses no \\ndifference between ram and static air pressure. The \\nairspeed indicator acts as if the airplane were stationary\\non the ramp. The apparent loss of airspeed is not \\nusually instantaneous. Instead, the airspeed will drop\\ntoward zero. [Figure 6-8]\\nIf the pitot tube, drain hole, and static system all\\nbecome blocked in flight, changes in airspeed will not\\nbe indicated, due to the trapped pressures. However, if\\nthe static system remains clear, the airspeed indicator\\nacts as an altimeter. An apparent increase in the ram air\\npressure relative to static pressure occurs as altitude\\nincreases above the level where the pitot tube and drain\\nhole became blocked. This pressure differential causes\\nthe airspeed indicator to show an increase in speed. A\\ndecrease in indicated airspeed occurs as the airplane\\ndescends below the altitude at which the pitot system\\nbecame blocked.

The most common\\ninstruments containing gyroscopes are the turn \\ncoordinator, heading indicator, and the attitude \\nindicator. To understand how these instruments operate\\nrequires knowledge of the instrument power systems,\\ngyroscopic principles, and the operating principles of\\neach instrument.\\nGYROSCOPIC PRINCIPLES\\nAny spinning object exhibits gyroscopic properties. A\\nwheel or rotor designed and mounted to utilize these\\nproperties is called a gyroscope. Two important design\\ncharacteristics of an instrument gyro are great weight\\nfor its size, or high density, and rotation at high speed\\nwith low friction bearings. \\nThere are two general types of mountings; the type used\\ndepends upon which property of the gyro is utilized. A\\nfreely or universally mounted gyroscope is free to rotate\\nin any direction about its center of gravity. Such a wheel\\nis said to have three planes of freedom. The wheel or\\nrotor is free to rotate in any plane in relation to the base\\nand is so balanced that with the gyro wheel at rest, it will\\nremain in the position in which it is placed. Restricted or\\nsemirigidly mounted gyroscopes are those mounted so\\nthat one of the planes of freedom is held fixed in relation\\nto the base.\\nThere are two fundamental properties of gyroscopic\\naction—rigidity in space and precession.\\nRIGIDITY IN SPACE\\nRigidity in space refers to the principle that a gyro-\\nscope remains in a fixed position in the plane in which\\nit is spinning. By mounting this wheel, or gyroscope,\\non a set of gimbal rings, the gyro is able to rotate freely\\nin any direction. Thus, if the gimbal rings are tilted,\\ntwisted, or otherwise moved, the gyro remains in the\\nplane in which it was originally spinning. [Figure 6-11]\\nPRECESSION\\nPrecession is the tilting or turning of a gyro in response\\nto a deflective force. The reaction to this force does not\\noccur at the point where it was applied; rather, it occurs\\nat a point that is 90° later in the direction of rotation.\\nThis principle allows the gyro to determine a rate of\\nturn by sensing the amount of pressure created by \\na change in direction. The rate at which the gyro \\nprecesses is inversely proportional to the speed of the\\nrotor and proportional to the deflective force.\\nPitot Tube\\nInaccurate\\nAirspeed\\nIndications\\nConstant Zero\\nIndication on VSI\\nFrozen\\nAltimeter\\nStatic\\nPort\\nBlockage\\nFigure 6-10.

Most airplanes have at\\nleast two sources of power to ensure at least one source\\nof bank information if one power source fails.\\nThe vacuum or pressure system spins the gyro by \\ndrawing a stream of air against the rotor vanes to spin\\nthe rotor at high speed, much like the operation of a\\nwaterwheel or turbine. The amount of vacuum or \\npressure required for instrument operation varies, but is\\nusually between 4.5 and 5.5 in. Hg.\\nOne source of vacuum for the gyros is a vane-type\\nengine-driven pump that is mounted on the accessory\\ncase of the engine. Pump capacity varies in different\\nairplanes, depending on the number of gyros.\\nA typical vacuum system consists of an engine-driven\\nvacuum pump, relief valve, air filter, gauge, and tubing\\nnecessary to complete the connections. The gauge is\\nmounted in the airplane’s instrument panel and indi-\\ncates the amount of pressure in the system (vacuum is \\nmeasured in inches of mercury less than ambient \\npressure).\\nAs shown in figure 6-13, air is drawn into the vacuum\\nsystem by the engine-driven vacuum pump. It first goes\\nthrough a filter, which prevents foreign matter from\\nentering the vacuum or pressure system. The air then\\nmoves through the attitude and heading indicators,\\nwhere it causes the gyros to spin. A relief valve \\nprevents the vacuum pressure, or suction, from exceed-\\ning prescribed limits. After that, the air is expelled\\noverboard or used in other systems, such as for \\ninflating pneumatic deicing boots.\\nIt is important to monitor vacuum pressure during\\nflight, because the attitude and heading indicators may\\nnot provide reliable information when suction pressure\\nis low. The vacuum, or suction, gauge generally is\\nmarked to indicate the normal range. Some airplanes\\nare equipped with a warning light that illuminates when\\nthe vacuum pressure drops below the acceptable level.\\nTURN INDICATORS\\nAirplanes use two types of turn indicators—the turn-\\nand-slip indicator and the turn coordinator.

[Figure 6-14]\\nTURN-AND-SLIP INDICATOR\\nThe gyro in the turn-and-slip indicator rotates in \\nthe vertical plane, corresponding to the airplane’s \\nlongitudinal axis. A single gimbal limits the planes in\\nwhich the gyro can tilt, and a spring tries to return it to\\ncenter. Because of precession, a yawing force causes\\nthe gyro to tilt left or right as viewed from the pilot seat.\\nThe turn-and-slip indicator uses a pointer, called the\\nturn needle, to show the direction and rate of turn.\\nTURN COORDINATOR\\nThe gimbal in the turn coordinator is canted; therefore,\\nits gyro can sense both rate of roll and rate of turn.\\nSince turn coordinators are more prevalent in training\\nairplanes, this discussion concentrates on that instru-\\nment. When rolling into or out of a turn, the miniature\\nairplane banks in the direction the airplane is rolled. A\\nrapid roll rate causes the miniature airplane to bank\\nmore steeply than a slow roll rate. \\nThe turn coordinator can be used to establish and \\nmaintain a standard-rate-turn by aligning the wing of\\nthe miniature airplane with the turn index. The turn\\ncoordinator indicates only the rate and direction of\\nturn; it does not display a specific angle of bank. \\nINCLINOMETER\\nThe inclinometer is used to depict airplane yaw, which\\nis the side-to-side movement of the airplane’s nose.\\nDuring coordinated, straight-and-level flight, the force\\nof gravity causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the\\ntube, centered between the reference lines. Coordinated\\nflight is maintained by keeping the ball centered. If the\\nball is not centered, it can be centered by using the rud-\\nder. To do this, apply rudder pressure on the side where\\nthe ball is deflected. Use the simple rule, “step on the\\nball,” to remember which rudder pedal to press. \\nIf aileron and rudder are coordinated during a turn, the\\nball remains centered in the tube.

The relationship of the miniature airplane to the\\nhorizon bar is the same as the relationship of the real\\nairplane to the actual horizon. The instrument gives an\\ninstantaneous indication of even the smallest changes\\nin attitude. \\nThe gyro in the attitude indicator is mounted on a hori-\\nzontal plane and depends upon rigidity in space for its\\noperation. The horizon bar represents the true horizon.\\nThis bar is fixed to the gyro and remains in a horizontal\\nplane as the airplane is pitched or banked about its \\nlateral or longitudinal axis, indicating the attitude of\\nthe airplane relative to the true horizon. [Figure 6-16]\\nAn adjustment knob is provided with which the pilot\\nmay move the miniature airplane up or down to align\\nthe miniature airplane with the horizon bar to suit the\\npilot’s line of vision. Normally, the miniature airplane\\nis adjusted so that the wings overlap the horizon bar\\nwhen the airplane is in straight-and-level cruising\\nflight.\\nThe pitch and bank limits depend upon the make and\\nmodel of the instrument. Limits in the banking plane\\nare usually from 100° to 110°, and the pitch limits are\\nusually from 60° to 70°. If either limit is exceeded, the\\ninstrument will tumble or spill and will give incorrect\\nindications until restabilized. A number of modern \\nattitude indicators will not tumble.\\nEvery pilot should be able to interpret the banking scale\\nillustrated in figure 6-17. Most banking scale indicators\\non the top of the instrument move in the same direction\\nfrom that in which the airplane is actually banked.\\nSome other models move in the opposite direction from\\nthat in which the airplane is actually banked. This may\\nconfuse the pilot if the indicator is used to determine\\nthe direction of bank. This scale should be used only to\\ncontrol the degree of desired bank. The relationship of\\nthe miniature airplane to the horizon bar should be used\\nfor an indication of the direction of bank.\\nThe attitude indicator is reliable and the most realistic\\nflight instrument on the instrument panel. Its indica-\\ntions are very close approximations of the actual \\nattitude of the airplane.\\nHEADING INDICATOR\\nThe heading indicator (or directional gyro) is funda-\\nmentally a mechanical instrument designed to facilitate\\nthe use of the magnetic compass. Errors in the \\nmagnetic compass are numerous, making straight flight\\nand precision turns to headings difficult to accomplish,\\nparticularly in turbulent air. A heading indicator, \\nhowever, is not affected by the forces that make the\\nmagnetic compass difficult to interpret.

The rotor turns in a\\nvertical plane, and fixed to the rotor is a compass card.\\nSince the rotor remains rigid in space, the points on the\\ncard hold the same position in space relative to the ver-\\ntical plane. As the instrument case and the airplane\\nrevolve around the vertical axis, the card provides clear\\nand accurate heading information.\\nBecause of precession, caused by friction, the heading\\nindicator will creep or drift from a heading to which it\\nis set. Among other factors, the amount of drift depends\\nlargely upon the condition of the instrument. If the\\nbearings are worn, dirty, or improperly lubricated, the\\ndrift may be excessive. Another error in the heading\\nindicator is caused by the fact that the gyro is oriented\\nin space, and the earth rotates in space at a rate of 15°\\nin 1 hour. Thus, discounting precession caused by fric-\\ntion, the heading indicator may indicate as much as 15°\\nerror per every hour of operation.\\nSome heading indicators receive a magnetic north refer-\\nence from a magnetic slaving transmitter, and generally\\nneed no adjustment. Heading indicators that do not have\\nthis automatic north-seeking capability are called “free”\\ngyros, and require periodic adjustment. It is important\\nto check the indications frequently (approximately\\nevery 15 minutes) and reset the heading indicator to\\nalign it with the magnetic compass when required.\\nAdjust the heading indicator to the magnetic compass\\nheading when the airplane is straight and level at a con-\\nstant speed to avoid compass errors.\\nThe bank and pitch limits of the heading indicator vary\\nwith the particular design and make of instrument. On\\nsome heading indicators found in light airplanes, the\\nlimits are approximately 55° of pitch and 55° of bank.\\nWhen either of these attitude limits is exceeded, the\\ninstrument “tumbles” or “spills” and no longer gives\\nthe correct indication until reset. After spilling, it may\\nbe reset with the caging knob. Many of the modern\\ninstruments used are designed in such a manner that\\nthey will not tumble.\\nInstrument Check— As the gyro spools up, make sure\\nthere are no abnormal sounds. While taxiing, the instrument\\nshould indicate turns in the correct direction, and \\nprecession should not be abnormal. At idle power \\nsettings, the gyroscopic instruments using the vacuum\\nsystem might not be up to operating speeds and preces-\\nsion might occur more rapidly than during flight. \\nMAGNETIC COMPASS\\nSince the magnetic compass works on the principle of\\nmagnetism, it is well for the pilot to have at least a basic\\nunderstanding of magnetism. A simple bar magnet has\\ntwo centers of magnetism which are called poles. Lines\\nof magnetic force flow out from each pole in all direc-\\ntions, eventually bending around and returning to the\\nother pole. The area through which these lines of force\\nflow is called the field of the magnet. For the purpose\\nof this discussion, the poles are designated “north” and\\n“south.” If two bar magnets are placed near each other,\\nthe north pole of one will attract the south pole of the\\nother. There is evidence that there is a magnetic field\\nsurrounding the Earth, and this theory is applied in the\\ndesign of the magnetic compass. It acts very much as\\nthough there were a huge bar magnet running along the\\naxis of the Earth which ends several hundred miles\\nbelow the surface. [Figure 6-19]\\nThe geographic north and south poles form the axis for\\nthe Earth’s rotation. These positions are also referred to\\nas true north and south. Another axis is formed by the\\nmagnetic north and south poles. Lines of magnetic\\nforce flow out from each pole in all directions, and\\neventually return to the opposite pole. A compass\\naligns itself with the magnetic axis formed by the\\nnorth/south magnetic field of the Earth. \\nThe lines of force have a vertical component (or pull)\\nwhich is zero at the Equator, but builds to 100 percent of\\nthe total force at the magnetic poles.

The amount of dip increases as the needles\\nare moved closer and closer to the poles. It is this\\ndeflection, or dip, that causes some of the larger \\ncompass errors.\\nThe magnetic compass, which is usually the only \\ndirection-seeking instrument in the airplane, is simple\\nin construction. It contains two steel magnetized \\nneedles fastened to a float, around which is mounted a\\ncompass card. The needles are parallel, with their\\nnorth-seeking ends pointing in the same direction. The\\ncompass card has letters for cardinal headings, and\\neach 30° interval is represented by a number, the last\\nzero of which is omitted.

It is\\nused to set the gyroscopic heading indicator, correct for\\nprecession, and as a backup in the event the heading\\nindicator(s) fails. [Figure 6-20]\\nCOMPASS ERRORS\\nVARIATION\\nAlthough the magnetic field of the Earth lies roughly\\nnorth and south, the Earth’s magnetic poles do not \\ncoincide with its geographic poles, which are used in\\nthe construction of aeronautical charts. Consequently,\\nat most places on the Earth’s surface, the direction-\\nsensitive steel needles that seek the Earth’s magnetic\\nfield will not point to true north, but to magnetic north.\\nFurthermore, local magnetic fields from mineral\\ndeposits and other conditions may distort the Earth’s\\nmagnetic field, and cause additional error in the \\nposition of the compass’ north-seeking magnetized\\nneedles with reference to true north. \\nThe angular difference between magnetic north, the\\nreference for the magnetic compass, and true north is\\nvariation.

These magnetic\\nfields distort the Earth’s magnetic force, and cause\\nthe compass to swing away from the correct heading.\\nThis error is called deviation. Manufacturers install\\ncompensating magnets within the compass housing\\nto reduce the effects of deviation. The magnets are\\nusually adjusted while the engine is running and all\\nelectrical equipment is operating. However, it is not\\npossible to completely eliminate deviation error;\\ntherefore, a compass correction card is mounted near\\nthe compass. This card corrects for deviation that\\noccurs from one heading to the next as the lines of\\nforce interact at different angles. [Figure 6-22]\\nMAGNETIC DIP\\nMagnetic dip is the result of the vertical component of\\nthe Earth’s magnetic field. This dip is virtually \\nnon-existent at the magnetic equator, since the lines of\\nforce are parallel to the Earth’s surface and the vertical\\ncomponent is minimal. When a compass is moved\\ntoward the poles, the vertical component increases, and \\nmagnetic dip becomes more apparent at higher \\nlatitudes. Magnetic dip is responsible for compass\\nerrors during acceleration, deceleration, and turns. \\nUSING THE MAGNETIC COMPASS\\nACCELERATION/DECELERATION ERRORS\\nAcceleration and deceleration errors are fluctuations in\\nthe compass during changes in speed. In the Northern\\nHemisphere, the compass swings towards the north\\nduring acceleration, and towards the south during\\ndeceleration. When the speed stabilizes, the compass\\nreturns to an accurate indication. This error is most \\npronounced when flying on a heading of east or west,\\nand decreases gradually when flying closer to a north\\nor south heading. The error does not occur when flying\\ndirectly north or south. The memory aid, ANDS\\n(Accelerate North, Decelerate South) may help in\\nrecalling this error. In the Southern Hemisphere, this\\nerror occurs in the opposite direction. \\nTURNING ERRORS\\nTurning errors are most apparent when turning to or\\nfrom a heading of north or south. This error increases\\nas the poles are neared and magnetic dip becomes more\\napparent. There is no turning error when flying near the\\nmagnetic equator. \\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, when making a turn from\\na northerly heading, the compass gives an initial \\nindication of a turn in the opposite direction. It then\\nbegins to show the turn in the proper direction, but lags\\nbehind the actual heading. The amount of lag decreases\\nas the turn continues, then disappears as the airplane\\nreaches a heading of east or west. When turning from a\\nheading of east or west to a heading of north, there is\\nno error as the turn begins. However, as the heading\\napproaches north, the compass increasingly lags behind\\nthe airplane’s actual heading. When making a turn from\\na southerly heading, the compass gives an indication\\nof a turn in the correct direction, but leads the actual\\nheading. This error also disappears as the airplane\\napproaches an east or west heading. Turning from east\\nor west to a heading of south causes the compass to\\nmove correctly at the start of a turn, but then it increas-\\ningly leads the actual heading as the airplane nears a\\nsoutherly direction.\\nThe amount of lead or lag is approximately equal to\\nthe latitude of the airplane. For example, if turning\\nfrom a heading of south to a heading of west while\\nflying at 40° north latitude, the compass rapidly turns\\nto a heading of 220° (180° + 40°). At the midpoint of\\nthe turn, the lead decreases to approximately half\\n(20°), and upon reaching a heading of west, it is zero. \\nThe magnetic compass, which is the only direction-seek-\\ning instrument in the airplane, should be read only when\\nthe airplane is flying straight and level at a constant speed.\\nThis will help reduce errors to a minimum. \\nIf the pilot thoroughly understands the errors and charac-\\nteristics of the magnetic compass, this instrument can\\nbecome the most reliable means of determining headings.\\nFOR (MH)\\nSTEER (CH)\\n0° 30° 60° 90° 120° 150° 180° 210° 240° 270° 300° 330°\\n359° 30° 60° 88° 120° 152° 183° 212° 240° 268° 300° 329°\\nRADIO ON RADIO OFF✓\\nFigure 6-22.

Originally, flight\\nmanuals followed whatever format and content the\\nmanufacturer felt was appropriate. This changed with\\nthe acceptance of the General Aviation Manufacturers\\nAssociation’s (GAMA) Specification for Pilot’s\\nOperating Handbook , which established a standard-\\nized format for all general aviation airplane and\\nrotorcraft flight manuals. The Pilot’s Operating\\nHandbook (POH) is developed by the airplane manu-\\nfacturer and contains the FAA-approved Airplane\\nFlight Manual (AFM) information. However, if\\nPilot’s Operating Handbook is used as the main title\\ninstead of Airplane Flight Manual , a statement must\\nbe included on the title page indicating that sections\\nof the document are FAA-approved as the Airplane\\nFlight Manual. [Figure 7-1]\\nAn airplane owner/information manual is a document\\ndeveloped by the airplane manufacturer containing gen-\\neral information about the make and model of airplane.\\nThe airplane owner’s manual is not FAA-approved and\\nis not specific to a particular serial numbered airplane.\\nThis manual provides general information about the\\noperation of the airplane and is not kept current, and\\ntherefore cannot be substituted for the AFM/POH.\\nBesides the preliminary pages, a POH may contain as\\nmany as ten sections. These sections are: General;\\nLimitations; Emergency Procedures; Normal Pro-\\ncedures; Performance; Weight and Balance/Equipment\\nList; Systems Description; Handling, Service, and\\nMaintenance; and Supplements. Manufacturers have\\nthe option of including a tenth section on Safety Tips,\\nas well as an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.\\nPRELIMINARY PAGES\\nWhile the AFM/POH may appear similar for the same\\nmake and model of airplane, each manual is unique\\nsince it contains specific information about a particular\\nairplane, such as the equipment installed and weight\\nand balance information. Therefore, manufacturers are\\nrequired to include the serial number and registration\\non the title page to identify the airplane to which the\\nmanual belongs. If a manual does not indicate a spe-\\ncific airplane registration and serial number, it is\\nlimited to general study purposes only.\\nMost manufacturers include a table of contents, which\\nidentifies the order of the entire manual by section\\nFigure 7-1.

It includes operating limitations, instru-\\nment markings, color-coding, and basic placards. Some\\nof the limitation areas are: airspeed, powerplant, weight\\nand loading distribution, and flight.\\nAIRSPEED\\nAirspeed limitations are shown on the airspeed indicator\\nby color-coding and on placards or graphs in the air-\\nplane. [Figure 7-2] A red line on the airspeed indicator\\nshows the airspeed limit beyond which structural damage\\ncould occur. This is called the never-exceed speed\\n(V\\nNE). A yellow arc indicates the speed range between\\nmaximum structural cruising speed (V NO) and V NE.\\nOperation of the airplane in the yellow airspeed arc is\\nfor smooth air only, and then with caution. A green arc\\ndepicts the normal operating speed range, with the\\nupper end at V\\nNO, and the lower end at stalling speed at\\nmaximum weight with the landing gear and flaps\\nretracted (V\\nS1). The flap operating range is depicted by\\nthe white arc, with the upper end at the maximum flap\\nextended speed (V\\nFE), and the lower end at the stalling\\nspeed with the landing gear and flaps in the landing\\nconfiguration (V\\nSO).\\nIn addition to the markings listed above, small multi-\\nengine airplanes will have a red radial line to indicate\\nsingle-engine minimum controllable airspeed (V\\nMC). A\\nblue radial line is used to indicate single-engine best\\nrate-of-climb speed at maximum weight at sea level\\n(V\\nYSE).\\nPOWERPLANT\\nThe Powerplant Limitations area describes operating\\nlimitations on the airplane’s reciprocating or turbine\\nengine(s). These include limitations for takeoff power,\\nmaximum continuous power, and maximum normal\\noperating power, which is the maximum power the\\nengine can produce without any restrictions, and is\\ndepicted by a green arc. Other items that can be\\nincluded in this area are the minimum and maximum\\noil and fuel pressures, oil and fuel grades, and propeller\\noperating limits. [Figure 7-3]\\nFigure 7-3. Minimum, maximum, and normal operating range\\nmarkings on oil gauge.\\nAll reciprocating-engine powered airplanes must have\\nan r.p.m. indicator for each engine. Airplanes equipped\\nwith a constant-speed propeller use a manifold pres-\\nsure gauge to monitor power output and an r.p.m. gauge\\nto monitor propeller speed. Both instruments depict the\\nmaximum operating limit with a red radial line and the\\nnormal operating range with a green arc. Some instru-\\nments may have a yellow arc to indicate a caution area.\\n[Figure 7-4]\\nWEIGHT AND LOADING DISTRIBUTION\\nThe Weight and Loading Distribution area contains the\\nmaximum certificated weights, as well as the center-of-\\ngravity (CG) range.

In addition, reg-\\nular and proper maintenance ensures that an aircraft\\nmeets an acceptable standard of airworthiness through-\\nout its operational life.\\nAlthough maintenance requirements vary for different\\ntypes of aircraft, experience shows that aircraft need\\nsome type of preventive maintenance every 25 hours of\\nflying time or less, and minor maintenance at least every\\n100 hours.

The interval depends upon the\\ntype of operations in which the aircraft is engaged.\\nSome aircraft need to be inspected at least once each\\n12-calendar months, while inspection is required for\\nothers after each 100 hours of operation. In some\\ninstances, an aircraft may be inspected in accordance\\nwith an inspection system set up to provide for total\\ninspection of the aircraft on the basis of calendar time,\\ntime in service, number of system operations, or any\\ncombination of these.\\nAll inspections should follow the current manufac-\\nturer’s maintenance manual, including the Instructions\\nfor Continued Airworthiness concerning inspections\\nintervals, parts replacement, and life-limited items as\\napplicable to the aircraft.\\nANNUAL INSPECTION\\nAny reciprocating-engine powered or single-engine-\\nturbojet/turbo-propeller powered small aircraft (12,500\\npounds and under) flown for business or pleasure and\\nnot flown for compensation or hire is required to be\\ninspected at least annually. The inspection shall be\\nperformed by a certificated airframe and powerplant\\n(A&P) mechanic who holds an Inspection Authorization\\n(IA), by the manufacturer, or by a certificated and appro-\\npriately rated repair station.

POHs and\\nowner/information manuals contain a section devoted\\nto a systematic method of performing a preflight\\ninspection.\\nMINIMUM EQUIPMENT LISTS (MEL) AND \\nOPERATIONS WITH INOPERATIVE EQUIPMENT\\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) requires that\\nall aircraft instruments and installed equipment are\\noperative prior to each departure. When the FAA\\nadopted the minimum equipment list (MEL) con-\\ncept for 14 CFR part 91 operations, this allowed for\\nthe first time, operations with inoperative items deter-\\nmined to be nonessential for safe flight. At the same\\ntime, it allowed part 91 operators, without an MEL, to\\ndefer repairs on nonessential equipment within the\\nguidelines of part 91.\\nThere are two primary methods of deferring main-\\ntenance on small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered\\nairplanes, gliders, or lighter-than-air aircraft operated\\nunder part 91. They are the deferral provision of 14\\nCFR part 91, section 91.213(d) and an FAA-approved\\nMEL.\\nThe deferral provision of section 91.213(d) is widely\\nused by most pilot/operators. Its popularity is due to\\nsimplicity and minimal paperwork. When inoperative\\nequipment is found during preflight or prior to depar-\\nture, the decision should be to cancel the flight, obtain\\nmaintenance prior to flight, or to defer the item or\\nequipment.\\nMaintenance deferrals are not used for in-flight dis-\\ncrepancies. The manufacturer’s AFM/POH procedures\\nare to be used in those situations. The discussion that\\nfollows assumes that the pilot wishes to defer mainte-\\nnance that would ordinarily be required prior to flight.\\nUsing the deferral provision of section 91.213(d), the\\npilot determines whether the inoperative equipment is\\nrequired by type design, the CFRs, or ADs. If the\\ninoperative item is not required, and the aircraft can\\nbe safely operated without it, the deferral may be made.\\nThe inoperative item shall be deactivated or removed\\nand an INOPERATIVE placard placed near the appro-\\npriate switch, control, or indicator. If deactivation or\\nremoval involves maintenance (removal always will),\\nit must be accomplished by certificated maintenance\\npersonnel.\\nFor example, if the position lights (installed equipment)\\nwere discovered to be inoperative prior to a daytime\\nflight, the pilot would follow the requirements of\\nsection 91.213(d).\\nThe deactivation may be a process as simple as the pilot\\npositioning a circuit breaker to the OFF position, or as\\ncomplex as rendering instruments or equipment totally\\ninoperable. Complex maintenance tasks require a cer-\\ntificated and appropriately rated maintenance person to\\nperform the deactivation. In all cases, the item or\\nequipment must be placarded INOPERATIVE.\\nMinimum Equipment List (MEL)—An inventory of instruments and\\nequipment that may legally be inoperative, with the specific conditions\\nunder which an aircraft may be flown with such items inoperative.\\nCh 07.qxd  10/24/03  7:04 AM  Page 7-8'),\n",

The operator then develops\\noperations and maintenance (O&M) procedures from\\nthe MMEL. This MMEL with O&M procedures now\\nbecomes the operator’s MEL. The MEL, LOA, pream-\\nble, and procedures document developed by the operator\\nmust be on board the aircraft when it is operated.\\nThe FAA considers an approved MEL to be a supple-\\nmental type certificate (STC) issued to an aircraft by\\nserial number and registration number. It therefore\\nbecomes the authority to operate that aircraft in a\\ncondition other than originally type certificated.\\nWith an approved MEL, if the position lights were\\ndiscovered inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the\\npilot would make an entry in the maintenance record\\nor discrepancy record provided for that purpose. The\\nitem is then either repaired or deferred in accordance\\nwith the MEL. Upon confirming that daytime flight\\nwith inoperative position lights is acceptable in\\naccordance with the provisions of the MEL, the pilot\\nwould leave the position lights switch OFF, open the\\ncircuit breaker (or whatever action is called for in the\\nprocedures document), and placard the position light\\nswitch as INOPERATIVE.\\nThere are exceptions to the use of the MEL for deferral.\\nFor example, should a component fail that is not listed\\nin the MEL as deferrable (the tachometer, flaps, or stall\\nwarning device, for example), then repairs are required\\nto be performed prior to departure. If maintenance or\\nparts are not readily available at that location, a special\\nflight permit can be obtained from the nearest FSDO.\\nThis permit allows the aircraft to be flown to another\\nlocation for maintenance. This allows an aircraft that\\nmay not currently meet applicable airworthiness\\nrequirements, but is capable of safe flight, to be\\noperated under the restrictive special terms and con-\\nditions attached to the special flight permit.\\nDeferral of maintenance is not to be taken lightly, and\\ndue consideration should be given to the effect an\\ninoperative component may have on the operation of\\nan aircraft, particularly if other items are inoperative.\\nFurther information regarding MELs and operations\\nwith inoperative equipment can be found in Advisory\\nCircular (AC) 91-67, Minimum Equipment Requirements\\nfor General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91.\\nPREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE\\nPreventive maintenance is considered to be simple or\\nminor preservation operations and the replacement of\\nsmall standard parts, not involving complex assembly\\noperations. Certificated pilots, excluding student pilots,\\nsport pilots, and recreational pilots, may perform\\npreventive maintenance on any aircraft that is owned\\nor operated by them provided that aircraft is not used\\nin air carrier service. (Sport pilots operating light\\nsport aircraft, refer to 14 CFR part 65 for maintenance\\nprivileges.) 14 CFR part 43, Appendix A, contains a list\\nof the operations that are considered to be preventive\\nmaintenance.\\nREPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS\\nRepairs and alterations are classified as either major or\\nminor. 14 CFR part 43, Appendix A, describes the\\nalterations and repairs considered major. Major repairs\\nor alterations shall be approved for return to service on\\nFAA Form 337, Major Repairs and Major Alterations,\\nby an appropriately rated certificated repair station, an\\nFAA certificated A&P mechanic holding an Inspection\\nAuthorization, or a representative of the Administrator.\\nMinor repairs and minor alterations may be approved\\nfor return to service with a proper entry in the mainte-\\nnance records by an FAA certificated A&P mechanic or\\nan appropriately certificated repair station.\\nFor modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the\\noperating limitations issued to that aircraft.\\nModifications in accordance with FAA Order 8130.2,\\nAirworthiness Certification of Aircraft and Related\\nProducts, may require the notification of the issuing\\nauthority.\\nSPECIAL FLIGHT PERMITS\\nA special flight permit is a Special Airworthiness\\nCertificate issued authorizing operation of an aircraft\\nthat does not currently meet applicable airworthiness\\nrequirements but is safe for a specific flight. Before the\\npermit is issued, an FAA inspector may personally\\ninspect the aircraft, or require it to be inspected by an\\nFAA certificated A&P mechanic or an appropriately\\ncertificated repair station, to determine its safety for the\\nintended flight. The inspection shall be recorded in the\\naircraft records.\\nCh 07.qxd  10/24/03  7:04 AM  Page 7-9'),\n",

Operating an airplane\\nabove the maximum weight limitation compromises\\nthe structural integrity of the airplane and adversely\\naffects its performance. Operation with the center of\\ngravity (CG) outside the approved limits may result in\\ncontrol difficulty.\\nWEIGHT CONTROL\\nWeight is the force with which gravity attracts a body\\ntoward the center of the earth. It is a product of the\\nmass of a body and the acceleration acting on the body.\\nWeight is a major factor in airplane construction and\\noperation, and demands respect from all pilots.\\nThe force of gravity continually attempts to pull the air-\\nplane down toward earth. The force of lift is the only\\nforce that counteracts weight and sustains the airplane\\nin flight. However, the amount of lift produced by an\\nairfoil is limited by the airfoil design, angle of attack,\\nairspeed, and air density. Therefore, to assure that the\\nlift generated is sufficient to counteract weight, loading\\nthe airplane beyond the manufacturer’s recommended\\nweight must be avoided. If the weight is greater than\\nthe lift generated, the airplane may be incapable of\\nflight.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT\\nAny item aboard the airplane that increases the total\\nweight is undesirable as far as performance is con-\\ncerned. Manufacturers attempt to make the airplane as\\nlight as possible without sacrificing strength or safety.\\nThe pilot of an airplane should always be aware of the\\nconsequences of overloading. An overloaded airplane\\nmay not be able to leave the ground, or if it does\\nbecome airborne, it may exhibit unexpected and\\nunusually poor flight characteristics. If an airplane is\\nnot properly loaded, the initial indication of poor per-\\nformance usually takes place during takeoff.\\nExcessive weight reduces the flight performance of an\\nairplane in almost every respect. The most important\\nperformance deficiencies of the overloaded airplane\\nare:\\n• Higher takeoff speed.\\n• Longer takeoff run.\\n• Reduced rate and angle of climb.\\n• Lower maximum altitude.\\n• Shorter range.\\n• Reduced cruising speed.\\n• Reduced maneuverability.\\n• Higher stalling speed.\\n• Higher approach and landing speed.\\n• Longer landing roll.\\n• Excessive weight on the nosewheel or tailwheel.\\nThe pilot must be knowledgeable in the effect of weight\\non the performance of the particular airplane being\\nflown. Preflight planning should include a check of\\nperformance charts to determine if the airplane’s\\nweight may contribute to hazardous flight operations.\\nExcessive weight in itself reduces the safety margins\\navailable to the pilot, and becomes even more hazardous\\nwhen other performance-reducing factors are combined\\nwith overweight.

If an engine fails on takeoff or air-\\nframe ice forms at low altitude, it is usually too late to\\nreduce the airplane’s weight to keep it in the air.\\nWEIGHT CHANGES\\nThe weight of the airplane can be changed by altering\\nthe fuel load. Gasoline has considerable weight—6\\npounds per gallon—30 gallons may weigh more than\\none passenger. But it must be remembered that if\\nweight is lowered by reducing fuel, the range of the air-\\nplane is decreased. During flight, fuel burn is normally\\nthe only weight change that takes place. As fuel is used,\\nthe airplane becomes lighter and performance is\\nimproved.\\nChanges of fixed equipment have a major effect upon\\nthe weight of the airplane. An airplane can be over-\\nloaded by the installation of extra radios or instruments.\\nRepairs or modifications may also affect the weight of\\nthe airplane.\\nBALANCE, STABILITY, AND \\nCENTER OF GRAVITY\\nBalance refers to the location of the center of gravity\\n(CG) of an airplane, and is important to airplane sta-\\nbility and safety in flight. The center of gravity is a\\npoint at which an airplane would balance if it were\\nsuspended at that point.\\nThe prime concern of airplane balancing is the fore\\nand aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis.\\nThe center of gravity is not necessarily a fixed point;\\nits location depends on the distribution of weight in\\nthe airplane. As variable load items are shifted or\\nexpended, there is a resultant shift in CG location. The\\npilot should realize that if the CG of an airplane is dis-\\nplaced too far forward on the longitudinal axis, a\\nnose-heavy condition will result. Conversely, if the\\nCG is displaced too far aft on the longitudinal axis, a\\ntail-heavy condition will result. It is possible that an\\nunfavorable location of the CG could produce such an\\nunstable condition that the pilot could not control the\\nairplane. [Figure 8-1]\\nLocation of the CG with reference to the lateral axis is\\nalso important. For each item of weight existing to the\\nleft of the fuselage centerline, there is an equal weight\\nexisting at a corresponding location on the right. This\\nmay be upset, however, by unbalanced lateral loading.\\nThe position of the lateral CG is not computed, but the\\npilot must be aware that adverse effects will certainly\\narise as a result of a laterally unbalanced condition.\\nLateral unbalance will occur if the fuel load is misman-\\naged by supplying the engine(s) unevenly from tanks\\non one side of the airplane. The pilot can compensate\\nfor the resulting wing-heavy condition by adjusting the\\naileron trim tab or by holding a constant aileron control\\npressure. However, this places the airplane controls in\\nan out-of-streamline condition, increases drag, and\\nresults in decreased operating efficiency. Since lateral\\nbalance is relatively easy to control and longitudinal\\nbalance is more critical, further reference to balance in\\nthis handbook will mean longitudinal location of the\\ncenter of gravity.\\nIn any event, flying an airplane that is out of balance\\ncan produce increased pilot fatigue with obvious\\neffects on the safety and efficiency of flight. The pilot’s\\nnatural correction for longitudinal unbalance is a change\\nof trim to remove the excessive control pressure.\\nExcessive trim, however, has the effect of not only\\nreducing aerodynamic efficiency but also reducing\\nprimary control travel distance in the direction the\\ntrim is applied.\\nEFFECTS OF ADVERSE BALANCE\\nAdverse balance conditions affect airplane flight\\ncharacteristics in much the same manner as those\\nmentioned for an excess weight condition. In addition,\\nthere are two essential airplane characteristics that may\\nbe seriously affected by improper balance; these are\\nstability and control. Loading in a nose-heavy condi-\\ntion causes problems in controlling and raising the\\nnose, especially during takeoff and landing. Loading\\nin a tail-heavy condition has a most serious effect\\nupon longitudinal stability, and can reduce the airplane’s\\ncapability to recover from stalls and spins. Another\\nundesirable characteristic produced from tail-heavy\\nloading is that it produces very light control forces. This\\nmakes it easy for the pilot to inadvertently overstress the\\nairplane.\\nLimits for the location of the airplane’s center of grav-\\nity are established by the manufacturer. These are the\\nfore and aft limits beyond which the CG should not be\\nlocated for flight. These limits are published for each\\nairplane in the Type Certificate Data Sheet, or Aircraft\\nSpecification and the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nFigure 8-1.

If, after loading, the\\nCG is not within the allowable limits, it will be neces-\\nsary to relocate some items within the airplane before\\nflight is attempted.\\nThe forward center-of-gravity limit is often established\\nat a location that is determined by the landing charac-\\nteristics of the airplane. During landing, which is one\\nof the most critical phases of flight, exceeding the\\nforward CG limit may result in excessive loads on\\nthe nosewheel; a tendency to nose over on tailwheel-\\ntype airplanes; decreased performance; higher\\nstalling speeds; and higher control forces. In extreme\\ncases, a CG location that is forward of the forward limit\\nmay result in nose heaviness to the extent that it may\\nbe difficult or impossible to flare for landing.\\nManufacturers purposely place the forward CG limit\\nas far rearward as possible to aid pilots in avoiding\\ndamage to the airplane when landing. In addition to\\ndecreased static and dynamic longitudinal stability,\\nother undesirable effects caused by a CG location aft\\nof the allowable range may include extreme control\\ndifficulty, violent stall characteristics, and very light\\nstick forces that make it easy to overstress the airplane\\ninadvertently.\\nA restricted forward center-of-gravity limit is also\\nspecified to assure that sufficient elevator deflection is\\navailable at minimum airspeed. When structural limi-\\ntations or large stick forces do not limit the forward\\nCG position, it is located at the position where full-up\\nelevator is required to obtain a high angle of attack for\\nlanding.\\nThe aft center-of-gravity limit is the most rearward\\nposition at which the CG can be located for the most\\ncritical maneuver or operation. As the CG moves aft,\\na less stable condition occurs, which decreases the\\nability of the airplane to right itself after maneuvering\\nor turbulence.\\nFor some airplanes the CG limits, both fore and aft,\\nmay be specified to vary as gross weight changes. They\\nmay also be changed for certain operations such as\\nacrobatic flight, retraction of the landing gear, or the\\ninstallation of special loads and devices that change the\\nflight characteristics.\\nThe actual location of the CG can be altered by many\\nvariable factors and is usually controlled by the pilot.\\nPlacement of baggage and cargo items determines the\\nCG location. The assignment of seats to passengers\\ncan also be used as a means of obtaining a favorable\\nbalance. If the airplane is tail-heavy, it is only logical\\nto place heavy passengers in forward seats. Also, fuel\\nburn can affect the CG based on the location of the fuel\\ntanks.\\nMANAGEMENT OF WEIGHT AND BALANCE\\nCONTROL\\nWeight and balance control should be a matter of con-\\ncern to all pilots. The pilot has control over loading\\nand fuel management (the two variable factors that\\ncan change both total weight and CG location) of a\\nparticular airplane.\\nThe airplane owner or operator should make certain\\nthat up-to-date information is available in the airplane\\nfor the pilot’s use, and should ensure that appropriate\\nentries are made in the airplane records when repairs or\\nmodifications have been accomplished. Weight\\nchanges must be accounted for and the proper notations\\nmade in weight and balance records. The equipment\\nlist must be updated, if appropriate. Without such infor-\\nmation, the pilot has no foundation upon which to base\\nthe necessary calculations and decisions.\\nBefore any flight, the pilot should determine the\\nweight and balance condition of the airplane. Simple\\nand orderly procedures, based on sound principles,\\nhave been devised by airplane manufacturers for the\\ndetermination of loading conditions. The pilot must\\nuse these procedures and exercise good judgment. In\\nmany modern airplanes, it is not possible to fill all\\nseats, baggage compartments, and fuel tanks, and still\\nremain within the approved weight and balance limits.\\nIf the maximum passenger load is carried, the pilot\\nmust often reduce the fuel load or reduce the amount\\nof baggage.\\nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS\\nThe pilot should be familiar with terms used in working\\nthe problems related to weight and balance. The follow-\\ning list of terms and their definitions is well standardized,\\nand knowledge of these terms will aid the pilot to better\\nunderstand weight and balance calculations of any\\nairplane.

This is quite\\nsimple; but to distribute this weight in such a manner\\nthat the entire mass of the loaded airplane is balanced\\naround a point (CG), which must be located within\\nspecified limits, presents a greater problem, particu-\\nlarly if the basic principles of weight and balance are\\nnot understood.\\nThe point where the airplane will balance can be deter-\\nmined by locating the center of gravity, which is, as\\nstated in the definitions of terms, the imaginary point\\nwhere all the weight is concentrated. To provide the\\nnecessary balance between longitudinal stability and\\nelevator control, the center of gravity is usually\\nlocated slightly forward of the center of lift. This\\nloading condition causes a nose-down tendency in\\nflight, which is desirable during flight at a high angle\\nof attack and slow speeds.\\nA safe zone within which the balance point (CG) must\\nfall is called the CG range. The extremities of the range\\nare called the forward CG limits and aft CG limits.\\nThese limits are usually specified in inches, along the\\nlongitudinal axis of the airplane, measured from a datum\\nreference. The datum is an arbitrary point, established by\\nairplane designers, which may vary in location between\\ndifferent airplanes. [Figure 8-2]\\nFigure 8-2. Weight and balance illustrated.\\nThe distance from the datum to any component part\\nof the airplane, or any object loaded on the airplane,\\nis called the arm. When the object or component is\\nlocated aft of the datum, it is measured in positive\\ninches; if located forward of the datum, it is measured\\nas negative inches, or minus inches. The location of\\nthe object or part is often referred to as the station. If\\nthe weight of any object or component is multiplied\\nby the distance from the datum (arm), the product is\\nthe moment. The moment is the measurement of the\\ngravitational force that causes a tendency of the\\nweight to rotate about a point or axis and is expressed\\nin pound-inches. \\nTo illustrate, assume a weight of 50 pounds is placed\\non the board at a station or point 100 inches from the\\ndatum. The downward force of the weight can be deter-\\nmined by multiplying 50 pounds by 100 inches, which\\nproduces a moment of 5,000 lb-in. [Figure 8-3]\\nFigure 8-3. Determining moments.\\nTo establish a balance, a total of 5,000 lb-in must be\\napplied to the other end of the board. Any combination\\nof weight and distance which, when multiplied, pro-\\nduces a 5,000 lb-in moment will balance the board. For\\nexample, as illustrated in figure 8-4, if a 100-pound\\nweight is placed at a point (station) 25 inches from the\\ndatum, and another 50-pound weight is placed at a\\npoint (station) 50 inches from the datum, the sum of the\\nproduct of the two weights and their distances will total\\na moment of 5,000 lb-in, which will balance the board.\\nFigure 8-4.

The loading conditions and empty\\nweight of a particular airplane may differ from that\\nfound in the AFM/POH because modifications or\\nequipment changes may have been made. Sample\\nloading problems in the AFM/POH are intended for\\nguidance only; therefore, each airplane must be\\ntreated separately. Although an airplane is certified\\nfor a specified maximum gross takeoff weight, it will\\nnot safely take off with this load under all conditions.\\nConditions that affect takeoff and climb performance\\nsuch as high elevations, high temperatures, and high\\nhumidity (high-density altitudes) may require a reduc-\\ntion in weight before flight is attempted. Other factors\\nto consider prior to takeoff are runway length, runway\\nsurface, runway slope, surface wind, and the presence\\nof obstacles. These factors may require a reduction in\\nweight prior to flight.\\nSome airplanes are designed so that it is difficult to\\nload them in a manner that will place the CG out of\\nlimits. These are usually small airplanes with the seats,\\nfuel, and baggage areas located near the CG limit.\\nThese airplanes, however, can be overloaded in\\nweight.\\nOther airplanes can be loaded in such a manner that\\nthey will be out of CG limits even though the useful\\nload has not been exceeded.\\nBecause of the effects of an out-of-balance or over-\\nweight condition, a pilot should always be sure that an\\nairplane is properly loaded.\\nDETERMINING LOADED WEIGHT AND\\nCENTER OF GRAVITY\\nThere are various methods for determining the loaded\\nweight and center of gravity of an aircraft. There is the\\ncomputation method, as well as methods that utilize\\ngraphs and tables provided by the aircraft manufac-\\nturer.\\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHOD\\nThe computational method involves the application of\\nbasic math functions. The following is an example of\\nthe computational method.\\nGiven:\\nMaximum Gross Weight  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3400 lb\\nCenter-of-Gravity Range  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78-86 in\\nFront Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 340 lb\\nRear Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 350 lb\\nFuel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75 gal\\nBaggage Area 1  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80 lb\\nTo determine the loaded weight and CG, follow these\\nsteps.\\nStep 1 —List the weight of the airplane, occu-\\npants, fuel, and baggage. Remember that fuel\\nweighs 6 pounds per gallon.\\nStep 2—Enter the moment for each item listed.\\nRemember “weight x arm = moment.” \\nStep 3—Total the weight and moments.\\nStep 4 —To determine the CG, divide the total\\nmoment by the total weight.\\nNOTE: The weight and balance records for a particular\\nairplane will provide the empty weight and moment as\\nwell as the information on the arm distance.\\nThe total loaded weight of 3,320 pounds does not\\nexceed the maximum gross weight of 3,400 pounds and\\nthe CG of 84.8 is within the 78-86 inch range; there-\\nfore, the airplane is loaded within limits.\\nGRAPH METHOD\\nAnother method for determining the loaded weight and\\nCG is the use of graphs provided by the manufacturers.\\nTo simplify calculations, the moment may sometimes\\nbe divided by 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The following is\\nan example of the graph method.

In this\\nexample, the total weight of the airplane less fuel is\\n4,240 pounds, which is under the zero fuel weight of\\n4,400 pounds. If the total weight of the airplane\\nwithout fuel had exceeded 4,400 pounds, passengers\\nor cargo would have to be reduced to bring the\\nweight at or below the max zero fuel weight.\\nSHIFTING, ADDING, AND REMOVING\\nWEIGHT\\nA pilot must be able to accurately and rapidly solve any\\nproblems that involve the shift, addition, or removal of\\nweight. For example, the pilot may load the aircraft\\nwithin the allowable takeoff weight limit, then find a\\nCG limit has been exceeded. The most satisfactory\\nsolution to this problem is to shift baggage, passen-\\ngers, or both. The pilot should be able to determine the\\nminimum load shift needed to make the aircraft safe\\nfor flight. Pilots should be able to determine if shifting\\na load to a new location will correct an out-of-limit\\ncondition. There are some standardized calculations\\nthat can help make these determinations.\\nWEIGHT SHIFTING\\nWhen weight is shifted from one location to another,\\nthe total weight of the aircraft is unchanged. The total\\nmoments, however, do change in relation and propor-\\ntion to the direction and distance the weight is moved.\\nWhen weight is moved forward, the total moments\\ndecrease; when weight is moved aft, total moments\\nincrease. The moment change is proportional to the\\namount of weight moved. Since many aircraft have\\nforward and aft baggage compartments, weight may\\nbe shifted from one to the other to change the CG. If\\nstarting with a known aircraft weight, CG, and total\\nmoments, calculate the new CG (after the weight shift)\\nby dividing the new total moments by the total aircraft\\nweight.\\nTo determine the new total moments, find out how\\nmany moments are gained or lost when the weight is\\nshifted. Assume that 100 pounds has been shifted from\\nstation 30 to station 150. This movement increases the\\ntotal moments of the aircraft by 12,000 lb-in.\\nMoment when \\nat station 150 = 100 lb x 150 in = 15,000 lb-in\\nMoment when \\nat station   30 = 100 lb  x  30 in = 3,000 lb-in\\nMoment change                              = 12,000 lb-in\\nBy adding the moment change to the original moment\\n(or subtracting if the weight has been moved forward\\ninstead of aft), the new total moments are obtained.\\nThen determine the new CG by dividing the new\\nmoments by the total weight:\\nTotal moments = 616,000 + 12,000 = 628,000\\nCG =          628,000 = 78.5 in\\n8,000 (Total weight)\\nThe shift has caused the CG to shift to station 78.5\\nA simpler solution may be obtained by using a com-\\nputer or calculator and a proportional formula. This\\ncan be done because the CG will shift a distance that is\\nproportional to the distance the weight is shifted.\\nFigure 8-8. Sample weight and balance using a negative.\\nFigure 8-9.

The use\\nof this data in flying operations is mandatory for safe\\nand efficient operation. Considerable knowledge and\\nfamiliarity of the airplane can be gained through study\\nof this material.\\nIt must be emphasized that the manufacturers’\\ninformation and data furnished in the AFM/POH is\\nnot standardized. Some provide the data in tabular\\nform, while others use graphs. In addition, the per-\\nformance data may be presented on the basis of\\nstandard atmospheric conditions, pressure altitude,\\nor density altitude. The performance information in\\nthe AFM/POH has little or no value unless the user\\nrecognizes those variations and makes the necessary\\nadjustments.\\nTo be able to make practical use of the airplane’s capa-\\nbilities and limitations, it is essential to understand the\\nsignificance of the operational data. The pilot must be\\ncognizant of the basis for the performance data, as well\\nas the meanings of the various terms used in expressing\\nperformance capabilities and limitations. \\nSince the characteristics of the atmosphere have a pre-\\ndominant effect on performance, it is necessary to\\nreview some of the dominant factors—pressure and\\ntemperature.\\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE\\nThe atmosphere is an envelope of air that surrounds the\\nearth and rests upon its surface. It is as much a part of\\nthe earth as the seas or the land. However, air differs\\nfrom land and water inasmuch as it is a mixture of\\ngases. It has mass, weight, and indefinite shape.\\nAir, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its\\nshape when subjected to even minute pressures because\\nof the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example,\\ngas will completely fill any container into which it is\\nplaced, expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to\\nthe limits of the container.\\nThe atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21\\npercent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as\\nargon or helium. Most of the oxygen is contained\\nbelow 35,000 feet altitude.\\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nThough there are various kinds of pressure, pilots are\\nmainly concerned with atmospheric pressure. It is one\\nof the basic factors in weather changes, helps to lift the\\nairplane, and actuates some of the important flight\\ninstruments in the airplane. These instruments are the\\naltimeter, the airspeed indicator, the rate-of-climb indi-\\ncator, and the manifold pressure gauge.\\nThough air is very light, it has mass and is affected\\nby the attraction of gravity.

Since it is a fluid substance, this force is\\nexerted equally in all directions, and its effect on\\nbodies within the air is called pressure. Under stan-\\ndard conditions at sea level, the average pressure\\nexerted by the weight of the atmosphere is approxi-\\nmately 14.7 lb./in. The density of air has significant\\neffects on the airplane’s performance. As air\\nbecomes less dense, it reduces: \\n• power because the engine takes in less air, \\n• thrust because the propeller is less efficient in\\nthin air, and \\n• lift because the thin air exerts less force on the\\nairfoils.\\nThe pressure of the atmosphere varies with time and\\nlocation. Due to the changing atmospheric pressure, a\\nstandard reference was developed. The standard atmos-\\nphere at sea level is a surface temperature of 59 °F or\\n15°C and a surface pressure of 29.92 in. Hg or 1013.2\\nmillibars. [Figure 9-1]\\nA standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the\\ntemperature decreases at the rate of approximately\\n3.5°F or 2°C per thousand feet up to 36,000 feet. Above\\nthis point, the temperature is considered constant up to\\n80,000 feet. A standard pressure lapse rate is one in\\nwhich pressure decreases at a rate of approximately 1\\nin. Hg per 1,000 feet of altitude gain to 10,000 feet.\\n[Figure 9-2] The International Civil Aviation\\nOrganization (ICAO) has established this as a world-\\nwide standard, and it is often referred to as\\nInternational Standard Atmosphere (ISA) or ICAO\\nStandard Atmosphere. Any temperature or pressure that\\ndiffers from the standard lapse rates is considered non-\\nstandard temperature and pressure. Adjustments for\\nnonstandard temperatures and pressures are provided\\non the manufacturer’s performance charts. \\nSince all airplane performance is compared and evalu-\\nated with respect to the standard atmosphere, all air-\\ncraft instruments are calibrated for the standard\\natmosphere. Thus, certain corrections must apply to the\\ninstrumentation, as well as the airplane performance, if\\nthe actual operating conditions do not fit the standard\\natmosphere. In order to account properly for the non-\\nstandard atmosphere, certain related terms must be\\ndefined.\\nPRESSURE ALTITUDE\\nPressure altitude is the height above a standard datum\\nplane. The airplane altimeter is essentially a sensitive\\nbarometer calibrated to indicate altitude in the standard\\natmosphere. If the altimeter is set for 29.92 in. Hg\\nStandard Datum Plane (SDP), the altitude indicated is\\nthe pressure altitude—the altitude in the standard\\natmosphere corresponding to the sensed pressure.\\nThe SDP is a theoretical level where the weight of the\\natmosphere is 29.92 in.

As the density of the air increases\\n(lower density altitude), airplane performance increases\\nand conversely as air density decreases (higher density\\naltitude), airplane performance decreases. A decrease in\\nair density means a high density altitude; and an\\nincrease in air density means a lower density altitude.\\nDensity altitude is used in calculating airplane perform-\\nance. Under standard atmospheric condition, air at each\\nlevel in the atmosphere has a specific density, and under\\nstandard conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude\\nidentify the same level. Density altitude, then, is the ver-\\ntical distance above sea level in the standard atmosphere\\nat which a given density is to be found.\\nThe computation of density altitude must involve\\nconsideration of pressure (pressure altitude) and\\ntemperature. Since airplane performance data at\\nany level is based upon air density under standard\\nday conditions, such performance data apply to air\\ndensity levels that may not be identical with altime-\\nter indications. Under conditions higher or lower\\nthan standard, these levels cannot be determined\\ndirectly from the altimeter.\\nDensity altitude is determined by first finding pressure\\naltitude, and then correcting this altitude for nonstan-\\ndard temperature variations. Since density varies\\ndirectly with pressure, and inversely with temperature,\\na given pressure altitude may exist for a wide range of\\ntemperature by allowing the density to vary. However,\\na known density occurs for any one temperature and\\npressure altitude. The density of the air, of course, has a\\npronounced effect on airplane and engine performance.\\nRegardless of the actual altitude at which the airplane\\nis operating, it will perform as though it were operating\\nat an altitude equal to the existing density altitude.\\nFor example, when set at 29.92, the altimeter may indi-\\ncate a pressure altitude of 5,000 feet. According to the\\nAFM/POH, the ground run on takeoff may require a dis-\\ntance of 790 feet under standard temperature conditions.\\nHowever, if the temperature is 20°C above standard, the\\nexpansion of air raises the density level. Using tempera-\\nture correction data from tables or graphs, or by deriving\\nthe density altitude with a computer, it may be found that\\nthe density level is above 7,000 feet, and the ground run\\nmay be closer to 1,000 feet.\\nAir density is affected by changes in altitude, temper-\\nature, and humidity. High density altitude refers to\\nthin air while low density altitude refers to dense air.\\nThe conditions that result in a high density altitude\\nare high elevations, low atmospheric pressures, high\\ntemperatures, high humidity, or some combination of\\nthese factors. Lower elevations, high atmospheric\\npressure, low temperatures, and low humidity are\\nmore indicative of low density altitude.\\nUsing a flight computer, density altitude can be com-\\nputed by inputting the pressure altitude and outside air\\ntemperature at flight level.

Conversely, when pressure on\\na given volume of air is decreased, the air expands and\\noccupies a greater space. That is, the original column\\nof air at a lower pressure contains a smaller mass of air.\\nIn other words, the density is decreased. In fact, density\\nis directly proportional to pressure. If the pressure is\\ndoubled, the density is doubled, and if the pressure is\\nlowered, so is the density. This statement is true only at\\na constant temperature.\\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON DENSITY\\nIncreasing the temperature of a substance decreases its\\ndensity. Conversely, decreasing the temperature\\nincreases the density. Thus, the density of air varies\\ninversely with temperature. This statement is true only\\nat a constant pressure.\\nIn the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure\\ndecrease with altitude, and have conflicting effects\\nupon density. However, the fairly rapid drop in pres-\\nsure as altitude is increased usually has the dominating\\neffect. Hence, pilots can expect the density to decrease\\nwith altitude.\\nEFFECT OF HUMIDITY (MOISTURE) ON\\nDENSITY\\nThe preceding paragraphs have assumed that the air\\nwas perfectly dry. In reality, it is never completely dry.\\nThe small amount of water vapor suspended in the\\natmosphere may be almost negligible under certain\\nconditions, but in other conditions humidity may\\nbecome an important factor in the performance of an\\nairplane. Water vapor is lighter than air; consequently,\\nmoist air is lighter than dry air. Therefore, as the water\\ncontent of the air increases, the air becomes less dense,\\nincreasing density altitude and decreasing perform-\\nance. It is lightest or least dense when, in a given set of\\nconditions, it contains the maximum amount of water\\nvapor.\\nHumidity, also called “relative humidity,” refers to the\\namount of water vapor contained in the atmosphere,\\nand is expressed as a percentage of the maximum\\namount of water vapor the air can hold. This amount\\nvaries with the temperature; warm air can hold more\\nwater vapor, while colder air can hold less. Perfectly\\ndry air that contains no water vapor has a relative\\nhumidity of 0 percent, while saturated air, that cannot\\nhold any more water vapor, has a relative humidity of\\n100 percent. Humidity alone is usually not considered\\nan important factor in calculating density altitude and\\nairplane performance; however, it does contribute.\\nThe higher the temperature, the greater amount of water\\nvapor that the air can hold. When comparing two separate\\nair masses, the first warm and moist (both qualities tending\\nto lighten the air) and the second cold and dry (both quali-\\nties making it heavier), the first necessarily must be less\\ndense than the second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity\\nhave a great influence on airplane performance because of\\ntheir effect upon density.

For example, the ability of\\nthe airplane to land and take off in a very short distance\\nis an important factor to the pilot who operates in and\\nout of short, unimproved airfields. The ability to carry\\nheavy loads, fly at high altitudes at fast speeds, or travel\\nlong distances is essential performance for operators of\\nairline and executive type airplanes.\\nThe chief elements of performance are the takeoff and\\nlanding distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload, range,\\nspeed, maneuverability, stability, and fuel economy.\\nSome of these factors are often directly opposed: for\\nexample, high speed versus shortness of landing dis-\\ntance; long range versus great payload; and high rate of\\nclimb versus fuel economy. It is the preeminence of one\\nor more of these factors which dictates differences\\nbetween airplanes and which explains the high degree\\nof specialization found in modern airplanes.\\nThe various items of airplane performance result from the\\ncombination of airplane and powerplant characteristics.\\nThe aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane generally\\ndefine the power and thrust requirements at various condi-\\ntions of flight while powerplant characteristics generally\\ndefine the power and thrust available at various conditions\\nof flight. The matching of the aerodynamic configuration\\nwith the powerplant is accomplished by the manufacturer\\nto provide maximum performance at the specific design\\ncondition; e.g., range, endurance, and climb.\\nSTRAIGHT-AND-LEVEL FLIGHT\\nAll of the principal items of flight performance involve\\nsteady-state flight conditions and equilibrium of the\\nairplane. For the airplane to remain in steady, level\\nflight, equilibrium must be obtained by a lift equal to\\nthe airplane weight and a powerplant thrust equal to the\\nairplane drag. Thus, the airplane drag defines the thrust\\nrequired to maintain steady, level flight.\\nAll parts of the airplane that are exposed to the air con-\\ntribute to the drag, though only the wings provide lift\\nof any significance. For this reason, and certain others\\nrelated to it, the total drag may be divided into two\\nparts: the wing drag (induced) and the drag of every-\\nthing but the wings (parasite).\\nThe total power required for flight then can be considered\\nas the sum of induced and parasite effects; that is, the total\\ndrag of the airplane. Parasite drag is the sum of pressure\\nand friction drag, which is due to the airplane’s basic con-\\nfiguration and, as defined, is independent of lift. Induced\\ndrag is the undesirable but unavoidable consequence of\\nthe development of lift.\\nWhile the parasite drag predominates at high speed,\\ninduced drag predominates at low speed. [Figure 9-5]\\nFor example, if an airplane in a steady flight condi-\\ntion at 100 knots is then accelerated to 200 knots, the\\nparasite drag becomes four times as great, but the\\npower required to overcome that drag is eight times\\nthe original value. Conversely, when the airplane is\\noperated in steady, level flight at twice as great a\\nspeed, the induced drag is one-fourth the original\\nvalue, and the power required to overcome that drag\\nis only one-half the original value.\\nThe wing or induced drag changes with speed in a very\\ndifferent way, because of the changes in the angle of\\nattack. Near the stalling speed, the wing is inclined to\\nthe relative wind at nearly the stalling angle, and its\\ndrag is very strong. But at cruise flying speed, with the\\nangle of attack nearly zero, induced drag is minimal.\\nAfter attaining cruise speed, the angle of attack changes\\nvery little with any further increase in speed, and the\\ndrag of the wing increases in direct proportion to any\\nfurther increase in speed. This does not consider the\\nfactor of compressibility drag that is involved at speeds\\nbeyond 260 knots.\\nTo sum up these changes, as the speed increases from\\nstalling speed to VNE, the induced drag decreases and\\nparasite drag increases.\\nWhen the airplane is in steady, level flight, the condi-\\ntion of equilibrium must prevail. The unaccelerated\\ncondition of flight is achieved with the airplane\\ntrimmed for lift equal to weight and the powerplant set\\nfor a thrust to equal the airplane drag.\\nThe maximum level flight speed for the airplane will\\nbe obtained when the power or thrust required equals\\nthe maximum power or thrust available from the\\nSpeed—Knots\\nDrag—Pounds\\nParasite Drag\\nInduced Drag\\nTotal Drag\\nStall\\nFigure 9-5.

[Figure 9-6] The minimum level flight\\nairspeed is not usually defined by thrust or power\\nrequirement since conditions of stall or stability and\\ncontrol problems generally predominate.\\nCLIMB PERFORMANCE\\nClimb depends upon the reserve power or thrust.\\nReserve power is the available power over and above\\nthat required to maintain horizontal flight at a given\\nspeed. Thus, if an airplane is equipped with an engine\\nthat produces 200 total available horsepower and the\\nairplane requires only 130 horsepower at a certain level\\nflight speed, the power available for climb is 70 horse-\\npower.\\nAlthough the terms “ power” and “thrust” are some-\\ntimes used interchangeably, erroneously implying that\\nthey are synonymous, it is important to distinguish\\nbetween the two when discussing climb performance.\\nWork is the product of a force moving through a\\ndistance and is usually independent of time. Work is\\nmeasured by several standards; the most common unit\\nis called a “foot-pound.” If a 1-pound mass is raised 1\\nfoot, a work unit of 1 foot-pound has been performed.\\nThe common unit of mechanical power is horse-\\npower; one horsepower is work equivalent to lifting\\n33,000 pounds a vertical distance of 1 foot in 1\\nminute. The term “power” implies work rate or units\\nof work per unit of time, and as such is a function of\\nthe speed at which the force is developed. “Thrust,”\\nalso a function of work, means the force that imparts\\na change in the velocity of a mass. This force is meas-\\nured in pounds but has no element of time or rate. It\\ncan be said then, that during a steady climb, the rate\\nof climb is a function of excess thrust.\\nWhen the airplane is in steady, level flight or with a\\nslight angle of climb, the vertical component of lift is\\nvery nearly the same as the actual total lift. Such climb-\\ning flight would exist with the lift very nearly equal to\\nthe weight. The net thrust of the powerplant may be\\ninclined relative to the flightpath, but this effect will be\\nneglected here for the sake of simplicity. Although the\\nweight of the airplane acts vertically, a component of\\nweight will act rearward along the flightpath. [Figure\\n9-7]\\nIf it is assumed that the airplane is in a steady climb\\nwith essentially a small inclination of the flightpath,\\nthe summation of forces along the flightpath resolves\\nto the following:\\nForces forward = Forces aft\\nThe basic relationship neglects some of the factors\\nthat may be of importance for airplanes of very high\\nclimb performance. (For example, a more detailed\\nconsideration would account for the inclination of\\nthrust from the flightpath, lift not being equal to\\nweight, and a subsequent change of induced drag.)\\nHowever, this basic relationship will define the\\nprincipal factors affecting climb performance.\\nThis relationship means that, for a given weight of the\\nairplane, the angle of climb depends on the difference\\nbetween thrust and drag, or the excess thrust. [Figure\\n9-8] Of course, when the excess thrust is zero, the incli-\\nnation of the flightpath is zero, and the airplane will be\\nin steady, level flight. When the thrust is greater than\\nthe drag, the excess thrust will allow a climb angle\\ndepending on the value of excess thrust. On the other\\nhand, when the thrust is less than the drag, the defi-\\nciency of thrust will allow an angle of descent.\\nThe most immediate interest in the climb angle\\nperformance involves obstacle clearance.

The vertical velocity of an\\nairplane depends on the flight speed and the inclination\\nof the flightpath. In fact, the rate of climb is the vertical\\ncomponent of the flightpath velocity.\\nFor rate of climb, the maximum rate would occur\\nwhere there exists the greatest difference between\\npower available and power required. [Figure 9-9] The\\nabove relationship means that, for a given weight of the\\nairplane, the rate of climb depends on the difference\\nbetween the power available and the power required, or\\nthe excess power. Of course, when the excess power is\\nzero, the rate of climb is zero and the airplane is in\\nsteady, level flight. When power available is greater\\nthan the power required, the excess power will allow a\\nrate of climb specific to the magnitude of excess power.\\nDuring a steady climb, the rate of climb will depend on\\nexcess power while the angle of climb is a function of\\nexcess thrust.\\nThe climb performance of an airplane is affected by\\ncertain variables. The conditions of the airplane’s\\nmaximum climb angle or maximum climb rate\\noccur at specific speeds, and variations in speed\\nwill produce variations in climb performance.\\nThere is sufficient latitude in most airplanes that\\nsmall variations in speed from the optimum do not\\nproduce large changes in climb performance, and\\ncertain operational considerations may require\\nspeeds slightly different from the optimum. Of\\ncourse, climb performance would be most critical\\nwith high gross weight, at high altitude, in\\nobstructed takeoff areas, or during malfunction of a\\npowerplant. Then, optimum climb speeds are nec-\\nessary.\\nWeight has a very pronounced effect on airplane per-\\nformance. If weight is added to the airplane, it must fly\\nat a higher angle of attack to maintain a given altitude\\nand speed. This increases the induced drag of the\\nwings, as well as the parasite drag of the airplane.\\nIncreased drag means that additional thrust is needed to\\novercome it, which in turn means that less reserve\\nthrust is available for climbing. Airplane designers go\\nto great effort to minimize the weight since it has such\\na marked effect on the factors pertaining to perform-\\nance.\\nA change in the airplane’s weight produces a twofold\\neffect on climb performance. First, a change in weight\\nwill change the drag and the power required. This alters\\nthe reserve power available, which in turn, affects both\\nthe climb angle and the climb rate. Secondly, an\\nincrease in weight will reduce the maximum rate of\\nclimb, but the airplane must be operated at a higher\\nclimb speed to achieve the smaller peak climb rate.\\nAn increase in altitude also will increase the power\\nrequired and decrease the power available. Therefore,\\nthe climb performance of an airplane diminishes with\\naltitude. The speeds for maximum rate of climb, maxi-\\nmum angle of climb, and maximum and minimum\\nlevel flight airspeeds vary with altitude. As altitude is\\nincreased, these various speeds finally converge at the\\nabsolute ceiling of the airplane.

The\\nservice ceiling is the altitude at which the airplane is\\nunable to climb at a rate greater than 100 feet per\\nminute. Usually, these specific performance reference\\npoints are provided for the airplane at a specific design\\nconfiguration. [Figure 9-10]\\nIn discussing performance, it frequently is convenient\\nto use the terms “power loading” and “wing loading.”\\nPower loading is expressed in pounds per horsepower\\nand is obtained by dividing the total weight of the air-\\nplane by the rated horsepower of the engine. It is a sig-\\nnificant factor in the airplane’s takeoff and climb\\ncapabilities.

These factors are\\ndiscussed in subsequent sections of this chapter.\\nRANGE PERFORMANCE\\nThe ability of an airplane to convert fuel energy into\\nflying distance is one of the most important items of\\nairplane performance. In flying operations, the prob-\\nlem of efficient range operation of an airplane appears\\nin two general forms: \\n1. to extract the maximum flying distance from a\\ngiven fuel load or, \\n2. to fly a specified distance with a minimum\\nexpenditure of fuel. \\nA common denominator for each of these operating\\nproblems is the “specific range”; that is, nautical miles\\nof flying distance per pound of fuel. Cruise flight\\noperations for maximum range should be conducted\\nso that the airplane obtains maximum specific range\\nthroughout the flight.\\nThe specific range can be defined by the following\\nrelationship:\\nnautical miles\\nspecific range  =  —————————-\\nlb. of fuel\\nor,\\nnautical miles/hr.\\nspecific range  =  ——————————-\\nlb. of fuel/hr.\\nor,\\nknots\\nspecific range  =  —————-\\nfuel flow\\nIf maximum specific range is desired, the flight condi-\\ntion must provide a maximum of speed per fuel flow.\\nRange must be clearly distinguished from the item of\\nendurance. [Figure 9-11] The item of range involves\\nconsideration of flying distance, while endurance\\ninvolves consideration of flying time. Thus, it is appro-\\npriate to define a separate term, “specific endurance.”\\nflight hours\\nspecific endurance  =  ———————-\\nlb. of fuel\\nor,\\nflight hours/hr.\\nspecific endurance  =  —————————\\nlb. of fuel/hr.\\nor,\\n1\\nspecific endurance  =  —————-\\nfuel flow\\nIf maximum endurance is desired, the flight condition\\nmust provide a minimum of fuel flow. While the peak\\nvalue of specific range would provide maximum range\\noperation, long-range cruise operation is generally rec-\\nommended at some slightly higher airspeed. Most\\nlong-range cruise operations are conducted at the flight\\ncondition that provides 99 percent of the absolute max-\\nimum specific range. The advantage of such operation\\nis that 1 percent of range is traded for 3 to 5 percent\\nhigher cruise speed. Since the higher cruise speed has a\\ngreat number of advantages, the small sacrifice of\\n9-8\\nAbsolute Ceiling\\nService Ceiling\\nFigure 9-10.

The values of specific range ver-\\nsus speed are affected by three principal variables: \\n1. airplane gross weight, \\n2. altitude, and \\n3. the external aerodynamic configuration of the air-\\nplane. These are the source of range and\\nendurance operating data included in the per-\\nformance section of the AFM/POH.\\n“Cruise control” of an airplane implies that the airplane\\nis operated to maintain the recommended long-range\\ncruise condition throughout the flight. Since fuel is\\nconsumed during cruise, the gross weight of the air-\\nplane will vary and optimum airspeed, altitude, and\\npower setting can also vary. “Cruise control” means the\\ncontrol of the optimum airspeed, altitude, and power\\nsetting to maintain the 99 percent maximum specific\\nrange condition. At the beginning of cruise flight, the\\nrelatively high initial weight of the airplane will require\\nspecific values of airspeed, altitude, and power setting\\nto produce the recommended cruise condition. As fuel\\nis consumed and the airplane’s gross weight decreases,\\nthe optimum airspeed and power setting may decrease,\\nor, the optimum altitude may increase. In addition, the\\noptimum specific range will increase. Therefore, the\\npilot must provide the proper cruise control procedure\\nto ensure that optimum conditions are maintained.\\nTotal range is dependent on both fuel available\\nand specific range. When range and economy of\\noperation are the principal goals, the pilot must\\nensure that the airplane will be operated at the\\nrecommended long- range cruise condition. By\\nthis procedure, the airplane will be capable of its\\nmaximum design-operating radius, or can\\nachieve flight distances less than the maximum\\nwith a maximum of fuel reserve at the destina-\\ntion.\\nThe propeller-driven airplane combines the propeller with\\nthe reciprocating engine for propulsive power. In the case\\nof the reciprocating engine, fuel flow is determined\\nmainly by the shaft power put into the propeller rather\\nthan thrust. Thus, the fuel flow can be related directly to\\nthe power required to maintain the airplane in steady, level\\nflight. This fact allows for the determination of range\\nthrough analysis of power required versus speed.\\nThe maximum endurance condition would be obtained\\nat the point of minimum power required since this\\nwould require the lowest fuel flow to keep the airplane\\nin steady, level flight. Maximum range condition would\\noccur where the proportion between speed and power\\nrequired is greatest. [Figure 9-11] \\nThe maximum range condition is obtained at maximum\\nlift/drag ratio (L/D max), and it is important to note that\\nfor a given airplane configuration, the maximum\\nlift/drag ratio occurs at a particular angle of attack and\\nlift coefficient, and is unaffected by weight or altitude.\\nA variation in weight will alter the values of airspeed\\nand power required to obtained the maximum lift/drag\\nratio. [Figure 9-12]\\nThe variations of speed and power required must\\nbe monitored by the pilot as part of the cruise\\ncontrol procedure to maintain the maximum\\nlift/drag ratio. When the airplane’s fuel weight is\\na small part of the gross weight and the airplane’s\\nrange is small, the cruise control procedure can\\nbe simplified to essentially maintaining a con-\\nstant speed and power setting throughout the\\ntime of cruise flight. The long-range airplane has\\na fuel weight that is a considerable part of the\\ngross weight, and cruise control procedures must\\nemploy scheduled airspeed and power changes to\\nmaintain optimum range conditions.\\nSpeed—Knots\\n Power Required—HP\\nMaximum\\nRange at\\n(L/D) MAX\\nMaximum\\nEndurance\\nat Min.

A flight conducted at high altitude will\\nhave a greater true airspeed, and the power required\\nwill be proportionately greater than when conducted\\nat sea level. The drag of the airplane at altitude is the\\nsame as the drag at sea level, but the higher true\\nairspeed causes a proportionately greater power\\nrequired. Note that the straight line that is tangent\\nto the sea level power curve is also tangent to the\\naltitude power curve.\\nThe effect of altitude on specific range also can be\\nappreciated from the previous relationships. If a change\\nin altitude causes identical changes in speed and power\\nrequired, the proportion of speed to power required\\nwould be unchanged. The fact implies that the specific\\nrange of the propeller-driven airplane would be unaf-\\nfected by altitude. Actually, this is true to the extent that\\nspecific fuel consumption and propeller efficiency are\\nthe principal factors that could cause a variation of spe-\\ncific range with altitude. If compressibility effects are\\nnegligible, any variation of specific range with altitude\\nis strictly a function of engine/propeller performance.\\nThe airplane equipped with the reciprocating engine\\nwill experience very little, if any, variation of specific\\nrange up to its absolute altitude. There is negligible\\nvariation of brake specific fuel consumption for val-\\nues of brake horsepower below the maximum cruise\\npower rating of the engine that is the lean range of\\nengine operation. Thus, an increase in altitude will\\nproduce a decrease in specific range only when the\\nincreased power requirement exceeds the maximum\\ncruise power rating of the engine. One advantage of\\nsupercharging is that the cruise power may be main-\\ntained at high altitude, and the airplane may achieve\\nthe range at high altitude with the corresponding\\nincrease in true airspeed. The principal differences in\\nthe high altitude cruise and low altitude cruise are the\\ntrue airspeeds and climb fuel requirements.\\nGROUND EFFECT\\nGround effect is due to the interference of the\\nsurface with the flow pattern about the airplane\\nin flight. Ground effect can be detected and\\nmeasured up to an altitude equal to one wing\\nspan above the surface. However, ground effect\\nis most significant when the airplane (especially\\nthe low-wing airplane) is maintaining a constant\\nattitude at low airspeed and low altitude (for\\nexample, during landing flare before touchdown,\\nand during takeoff when the airplane lifts off and\\naccelerates to climb speed).\\nWhen the wing is under the influence of ground\\neffect, there is a reduction in upwash, downwash, and\\ntip vortices. As a result of the reduced tip vortices,\\ninduced drag is reduced. When the wing is at a height\\nequal to one-fourth the span, the reduction in induced\\ndrag is about 25 percent, and when the wing is at a\\nheight equal to one-tenth the span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is about 50 percent. At high speeds\\nwhere parasite drag predominates, induced drag is a\\nsmall part of the total drag. Consequently, the effects\\nof ground effect are of greater concern during takeoff\\nand landing. [Figure 9-14]\\nAssuming that the airplane descends into ground effect\\nmaintaining a constant angle of attack and a constant\\nairspeed, the following effects will take place:\\nBecause of the reduction in drag, a smaller wing\\nangle of attack will be required to produce the same\\nlift coefficient or, if a constant wing angle of attack\\nis maintained, the wing will experience an increase\\nin lift coefficient.\\nAs a result of the reduction in drag, the thrust required\\nat low speeds will be reduced.\\nThe reduction in downwash at the horizontal tail will\\nreduce the effectiveness of the elevator. It may cause a\\npitch-down tendency, thus requiring greater up elevator\\nto trim the airplane.\\nIn the majority of cases, ground effect will cause an\\nincrease in pressure at the static source and produce a\\nlower indication of airspeed and altitude.\\nDuring the landing flare when the airplane is brought\\ninto ground effect at a constant angle of attack, the air-\\nplane will experience an increase in lift coefficient.\\nSpeed—Knots\\n Power Required—HP\\nL/D MAX\\nConstant\\nWeight\\nSea Level\\nAt Altitude\\nFigure 9-13.

However, as the airplane rises out of ground\\neffect with an insufficient airspeed, initial climb per-\\nformance may prove to be marginal because of the\\nincreased drag. Under extreme conditions such as high-\\ndensity altitude, high temperature, and maximum gross\\nweight, the airplane may be able to become airborne at\\nan insufficient airspeed, but unable to fly out of ground\\neffect. Consequently, the airplane may not be able to\\nclear an obstruction, or may settle back on the runway.\\nUnder marginal conditions, it is important the airplane\\ntakes off at the recommended speed that will provide\\nadequate initial climb performance. If the runway is\\nlong enough, or no obstacles exist, ground effect can be\\nused to an advantage by using the reduced drag to\\nimprove initial acceleration. Ground effect is important\\nto normal flight operations in the performance of soft\\nand rough field takeoffs and landings. The procedure\\nfor takeoff from these surfaces is to transfer as much\\nweight as possible to the wings during the ground run,\\nand to lift off with the aid of ground effect before true\\nflying speed is attained. It is then necessary to reduce\\nthe angle of attack gradually until normal airspeed is\\nattained before attempting to climb away from the\\nground effect.\\nREGION OF REVERSED COMMAND\\nThe aerodynamic properties of the airplane generally\\ndetermine the power requirements at various conditions\\nof flight, while the powerplant capabilities generally\\ndetermine the power available at various conditions of\\nflight. When the airplane is in steady, level flight, the\\ncondition of equilibrium must prevail. An unaccelerated\\ncondition of flight is achieved when lift equals weight,\\nand the powerplant is set for a thrust equal to the airplane\\ndrag. The power required to achieve equilibrium in con-\\nstant-altitude flight at various airspeeds is depicted on a\\npower required curve. The power required curve illus-\\ntrates the fact that at low airspeeds near the stall or mini-\\nmum controllable airspeed, the power setting required\\nfor steady, level flight is quite high.\\nFlight in the region of normal command means that\\nwhile holding a constant altitude, a higher airspeed\\nrequires a higher power setting and a lower airspeed\\nrequires a lower power setting. The majority of all air-\\nplane flying (climb, cruise, and maneuvers) is con-\\nducted in the region of normal command.\\nFlight in the region of reversed command means that\\na higher airspeed requires a lower power setting and a\\nlower airspeed requires a higher power setting to hold\\naltitude. It does not imply that a decrease in power will\\nproduce lower airspeed. The region of reversed com-\\nmand is encountered in the low speed phases of flight.\\nFlight speeds below the speed for maximum endurance\\n(lowest point on the power curve) require higher power\\nsettings with a decrease in airspeed. Since the need to\\nincrease the required power setting with decreased\\nspeed is contrary to the normal command of flight, the\\nregime of flight speeds between the speed for minimum\\nrequired power setting and the stall speed (or minimum\\ncontrol speed) is termed the region of reversed com-\\nmand. In the region of reversed command, a decrease\\nin airspeed must be accompanied by an increased\\npower setting in order to maintain steady flight.\\nFigure 9-15 shows the “maximum power available” as a\\ncurved line. Lower power settings, such as cruise power,\\nwould also appear in a similar curve.

Even\\nwith full power, the airplane may be incapable of\\nclimbing or even maintaining altitude. The pilot’s only\\nrecourse in this situation is to lower the pitch attitude in\\norder to increase airspeed, which will inevitably result\\nin a loss of altitude.\\nAirplane pilots must give particular attention to precise\\ncontrol of airspeed when operating in the low flight\\nspeeds of the region of reversed command.\\nRUNWAY SURFACE AND GRADIENT\\nRunway conditions affect takeoff and landing perform-\\nance. Typically, performance chart information assumes\\npaved, level, smooth, and dry runway surfaces. Since no\\ntwo runways are alike, the runway surface differs from\\none runway to another, as does the runway gradient or\\nslope. [Figure 9-16]\\nRunway surfaces vary widely from one airport to\\nanother. The runway surface encountered may be con-\\ncrete, asphalt, gravel, dirt, or grass. The runway surface\\nfor a specific airport is noted in the Airport/Facility\\nDirectory. Any surface that is not hard and smooth will\\nincrease the ground roll during takeoff. This is due to\\nthe inability of the tires to smoothly roll along the run-\\nway. Tires can sink into soft, grassy, or muddy run-\\nways. Potholes or other ruts in the pavement can be the\\ncause of poor tire movement along the runway.\\nObstructions such as mud, snow, or standing water\\nreduce the airplane’s acceleration down the runway.\\nAlthough muddy and wet surface conditions can reduce\\nfriction between the runway and the tires, they can also\\nact as obstructions and reduce the landing distance.\\n[Figure 9-17]\\nBraking effectiveness is another consideration when\\ndealing with various runway types. The condition of\\nthe surface affects the braking ability of the airplane.\\nFigure 9-16. Charts assume paved, level, dry runway conditions.\\nFigure 9-17.

This means that for every 100 feet of\\nrunway length, the runway height changes by 3 feet. A\\npositive gradient indicates that the runway height\\nincreases, and a negative gradient indicates that the\\nrunway decreases in height. An upsloping runway\\nimpedes acceleration and results in a longer ground run\\nduring takeoff. However, landing on an upsloping run-\\nway typically reduces the landing roll. A downsloping\\nrunway aids in acceleration on takeoff resulting in\\nshorter takeoff distances. The opposite is true when\\nlanding, as landing on a downsloping runway increases\\nlanding distances. Runway slope information is con-\\ntained in the Airport/Facility Directory. [Figure 9-18]\\nWATER ON THE RUNWAY AND DYNAMIC\\nHYDROPLANING\\nWater on the runways reduces the friction between\\nthe tires and the ground, and can reduce braking\\neffectiveness. The ability to brake can be completely\\nlost when the tires are hydroplaning because a layer\\nof water separates the tires from the runway surface.\\nThis is also true of braking effectiveness when\\nrunways are covered in ice.\\nWhen the runway is wet, the pilot may be confronted\\nwith dynamic hydroplaning.

Opt for a suitable runway most aligned\\nwith the wind. Mechanical braking may be ineffective,\\nso aerodynamic braking should be used to its fullest\\nadvantage.\\nTAKEOFF AND LANDING\\nPERFORMANCE\\nThe majority of pilot-caused airplane accidents occur\\nduring the takeoff and landing phase of flight.\\nBecause of this fact, the pilot must be familiar with all\\nthe variables that influence the takeoff and landing\\nperformance of an airplane and must strive for exact-\\ning, professional procedures of operation during these\\nphases of flight.\\nTakeoff and landing performance is a condition of\\naccelerated and decelerated motion. For instance,\\nduring takeoff, the airplane starts at zero speed and\\naccelerates to the takeoff speed to become airborne.\\nDuring landing, the airplane touches down at the\\nlanding speed and decelerates to zero speed.\\nThe important factors of takeoff or landing performance\\nare as follows:\\n• The takeoff or landing speed which will\\ngenerally be a function of the stall speed or\\nminimum flying speed.\\n• The rate of acceleration and deceleration during\\nthe takeoff or landing roll. The acceleration and\\ndeceleration experienced by any object varies\\ndirectly with the imbalance of force and inversely\\nwith the mass of the object.\\n• The takeoff or landing roll distance is a function\\nof both acceleration/deceleration and speed.\\nTAKEOFF PERFORMANCE\\nThe minimum takeoff distance is of primary interest in\\nthe operation of any airplane because it defines the run-\\nway requirements. The minimum takeoff distance is\\nobtained by taking off at some minimum safe speed\\nthat allows sufficient margin above stall and provides\\nsatisfactory control and initial rate of climb. Generally,\\nthe lift-off speed is some fixed percentage of the stall\\nspeed or minimum control speed for the airplane in the\\ntakeoff configuration. As such, the lift-off will be\\naccomplished at some particular value of lift coeffi-\\ncient and angle of attack. Depending on the airplane\\ncharacteristics, the lift-off speed will be anywhere from\\n1.05 to 1.25 times the stall speed or minimum control\\nspeed.\\nTo obtain minimum takeoff distance at the specific\\nlift-off speed, the forces that act on the airplane must\\nprovide the maximum acceleration during the takeoff\\nroll. The various forces acting on the airplane may or\\nmay not be under the control of the pilot, and various\\nprocedures may be necessary in certain airplanes to\\nmaintain takeoff acceleration at the highest value.\\nThe powerplant thrust is the principal force to provide\\nthe acceleration and, for minimum takeoff distance, the\\noutput thrust should be at a maximum. Lift and drag\\nare produced as soon as the airplane has speed, and the\\nvalues of lift and drag depend on the angle of attack\\nand dynamic pressure.\\nIn addition to the important factors of proper pro-\\ncedures, many other variables affect the takeoff\\nperformance of an airplane. Any item that alters the\\ntakeoff speed or acceleration rate during the takeoff roll\\nwill affect the takeoff distance.\\nFor example, the effect of gross weight on takeoff dis-\\ntance is significant and proper consideration of this\\nitem must be made in predicting the airplane’s takeoff\\ndistance. Increased gross weight can be considered to\\nproduce a threefold effect on takeoff performance: \\n1. higher lift-off speed, \\n2. greater mass to accelerate, and \\n3. increased retarding force (drag and ground friction).\\nIf the gross weight increases, a greater speed is nec-\\nessary to produce the greater lift necessary to get the\\nairplane airborne at the takeoff lift coefficient.

Such a pow-\\nerful effect requires proper consideration of gross\\nweight in predicting takeoff distance.\\nThe effect of wind on takeoff distance is large, and\\nproper consideration also must be provided when pre-\\ndicting takeoff distance. The effect of a headwind is to\\nallow the airplane to reach the lift-off speed at a lower\\ngroundspeed while the effect of a tailwind is to require\\nthe airplane to achieve a greater groundspeed to attain\\nthe lift-off speed.\\nA headwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed will\\nreduce the takeoff distance approximately 19 percent.\\nHowever, a tailwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff air-\\nspeed will increase the takeoff distance approximately\\n21 percent. In the case where the headwind speed is 50\\npercent of the takeoff speed, the takeoff distance would\\nbe approximately 25 percent of the zero wind takeoff\\ndistance (75 percent reduction).\\nThe effect of wind on landing distance is identical to\\nthe effect on takeoff distance. Figure 9-20 illustrates\\nthe general effect of wind by the percent change in\\ntakeoff or landing distance as a function of the ratio of\\nwind velocity to takeoff or landing speed.\\nThe effect of proper takeoff speed is especially important when\\nrunway lengths and takeoff distances are critical. The takeoff\\nspeeds specified in the AFM/POH are generally the minimum\\nsafe speeds at which the airplane can become airborne. Any\\nattempt to take off below the recommended speed could mean\\nthat the airplane may stall, be difficult to control, or have a very\\nlow initial rate of climb. In some cases, an excessive angle of\\nattack may not allow the airplane to climb out of ground effect.\\nOn the other hand, an excessive airspeed at takeoff may\\nimprove the initial rate of climb and “feel” of the airplane, but\\nwill produce an undesirable increase in takeoff distance.\\nAssuming that the acceleration is essentially unaffected, the\\ntakeoff distance varies as the square of the takeoff velocity.\\nThus, 10 percent excess airspeed would increase the\\ntakeoff distance 21 percent. In most critical takeoff\\nconditions, such an increase in takeoff distance would\\nbe prohibitive, and the pilot must adhere to the recom-\\nmended takeoff speeds.\\nThe effect of pressure altitude and ambient temperature\\nis to define primarily the density altitude and its effect\\non takeoff performance. While subsequent corrections\\nare appropriate for the effect of temperature on certain\\nitems of powerplant performance, density altitude\\ndefines specific effects on takeoff performance. An\\nincrease in density altitude can produce a twofold\\neffect on takeoff performance: \\n1. greater takeoff speed and \\n2. decreased thrust and reduced net accelerating\\nforce.\\nIf an airplane of given weight and configuration is\\noperated at greater heights above standard sea level,\\nthe airplane will still require the same dynamic pres-\\nsure to become airborne at the takeoff lift coefficient.\\nThus, the airplane at altitude will take off at the same\\nindicated airspeed as at sea level, but because of the\\nreduced air density, the true airspeed will be greater.\\nThe effect of density altitude on powerplant thrust\\ndepends much on the type of powerplant. An increase in\\naltitude above standard sea level will bring an immedi-\\nate decrease in power output for the unsupercharged\\nreciprocating engine. However, an increase in altitude\\nabove standard sea level will not cause a decrease in\\npower output for the supercharged reciprocating engine\\nuntil the altitude exceeds the critical operating altitude.\\nFor those powerplants that experience a decay in thrust\\nwith an increase in altitude, the effect on the net acceler-\\nating force and acceleration rate can be approximated by\\nassuming a direct variation with density.

In all\\ncases, the pilot must make an accurate prediction of\\ntakeoff distance from the performance data of the\\nAFM/POH, regardless of the runway available, and\\nstrive for a polished, professional takeoff procedure.\\nIn the prediction of takeoff distance from the\\nAFM/POH data, the following primary considerations\\nmust be given:\\n• Pressure altitude and temperature—to define the\\neffect of density altitude on distance.\\n• Gross weight—a large effect on distance.\\n• Wind—a large effect due to the wind or wind\\ncomponent along the runway.\\n• Runway slope and condition—the effect of an\\nincline and the retarding effect of factors such as\\nsnow or ice.\\nLANDING PERFORMANCE\\nIn many cases, the landing distance of an airplane will\\ndefine the runway requirements for flying operations.\\nThe minimum landing distance is obtained by landing\\nat some minimum safe speed, which allows sufficient\\nmargin above stall and provides satisfactory control\\nand capability for a go-around. Generally, the landing\\nspeed is some fixed percentage of the stall speed or\\nminimum control speed for the airplane in the landing\\nconfiguration. As such, the landing will be accom-\\nplished at some particular value of lift coefficient and\\nangle of attack. The exact values will depend on the\\nairplane characteristics but, once defined, the values\\nare independent of weight, altitude, and wind.\\nTo obtain minimum landing distance at the specified\\nlanding speed, the forces that act on the airplane must\\nprovide maximum deceleration during the landing roll.\\nThe forces acting on the airplane during the landing roll\\nmay require various procedures to maintain landing\\ndeceleration at the peak value.\\nA distinction should be made between the procedures\\nfor minimum landing distance and an ordinary landing\\nroll with considerable excess runway available.\\nMinimum landing distance will be obtained by creating\\na continuous peak deceleration of the airplane; that is,\\nextensive use of the brakes for maximum deceleration.\\nOn the other hand, an ordinary landing roll with con-\\nsiderable excess runway may allow extensive use of\\naerodynamic drag to minimize wear and tear on the\\ntires and brakes. If aerodynamic drag is sufficient to\\ncause deceleration of the airplane, it can be used in def-\\nerence to the brakes in the early stages of the landing\\nroll; i.e., brakes and tires suffer from continuous hard\\nuse, but airplane aerodynamic drag is free and does not\\nwear out with use. The use of aerodynamic drag is\\napplicable only for deceleration to 60 or 70 percent of\\nthe touchdown speed. At speeds less than 60 to 70 per-\\ncent of the touchdown speed, aerodynamic drag is so\\nslight as to be of little use, and braking must be utilized\\nto produce continued deceleration of the airplane.\\nSince the objective during the landing roll is to deceler-\\nate, the powerplant thrust should be the smallest\\npossible positive value (or largest possible negative\\nvalue in the case of thrust reversers).\\nIn addition to the important factors of proper pro-\\ncedures, many other variables affect the landing\\nperformance. Any item that alters the landing speed\\nor deceleration rate during the landing roll will\\naffect the landing distance.\\nThe effect of gross weight on landing distance is one of\\nthe principal items determining the landing distance.\\nOne effect of an increased gross weight is that a greater\\nspeed will be required to support the airplane at the\\nlanding angle of attack and lift coefficient.\\nFor an example of the effect of a change in gross\\nweight, a 21 percent increase in landing weight will\\nrequire a 10 percent increase in landing speed to sup-\\nport the greater weight.\\nWhen minimum landing distances are considered,\\nbraking friction forces predominate during the landing\\nroll and, for the majority of airplane configurations,\\nbraking friction is the main source of deceleration.\\nThe minimum landing distance will vary in direct pro-\\nportion to the gross weight. For example, a 10 percent\\nincrease in gross weight at landing would cause a: \\n• 5 percent increase in landing velocity and \\n• 10 percent increase in landing distance.\\nA contingency of this is the relationship between\\nweight and braking friction force.\\nThe effect of wind on landing distance is large and\\ndeserves proper consideration when predicting landing\\ndistance. Since the airplane will land at a particular air-\\nspeed independent of the wind, the principal effect of\\nwind on landing distance is due to the change in the\\ngroundspeed at which the airplane touches down. The\\neffect of wind on deceleration during the landing is\\nidentical to the effect on acceleration during the take-\\noff.\\nA headwind that is 10 percent of the landing airspeed will\\nreduce the landing distance approximately 19 percent, but\\nCh 09.qxd  10/24/03  7:23 AM  Page 9-17'),\n",

An increase in density altitude will\\nincrease the landing speed but will not alter the net\\nretarding force. Thus, the airplane at altitude will land\\nat the same indicated airspeed as at sea level but,\\nbecause of the reduced density, the true airspeed (TAS)\\nwill be greater. Since the airplane lands at altitude with\\nthe same weight and dynamic pressure, the drag and\\nbraking friction throughout the landing roll have the\\nsame values as at sea level. As long as the condition is\\nwithin the capability of the brakes, the net retarding\\nforce is unchanged, and the deceleration is the same as\\nwith the landing at sea level. Since an increase in alti-\\ntude does not alter deceleration, the effect of density\\naltitude on landing distance would actually be due to\\nthe greater TAS.\\nThe minimum landing distance at 5,000 feet would be\\n16 percent greater than the minimum landing distance\\nat sea level. The approximate increase in landing dis-\\ntance with altitude is approximately 3 1/2 percent for\\neach 1,000 feet of altitude. Proper accounting of den-\\nsity altitude is necessary to accurately predict landing\\ndistance.\\nThe effect of proper landing speed is important when\\nrunway lengths and landing distances are critical. The\\nlanding speeds specified in the AFM/POH are gener-\\nally the minimum safe speeds at which the airplane can\\nbe landed. Any attempt to land at below the specified\\nspeed may mean that the airplane may stall, be difficult\\nto control, or develop high rates of descent. On the\\nother hand, an excessive speed at landing may improve\\nthe controllability slightly (especially in crosswinds),\\nbut will cause an undesirable increase in landing dis-\\ntance.\\nA 10 percent excess landing speed would cause at least\\na 21 percent increase in landing distance. The excess\\nspeed places a greater working load on the brakes\\nbecause of the additional kinetic energy to be dissi-\\npated. Also, the additional speed causes increased drag\\nand lift in the normal ground attitude, and the increased\\nlift will reduce the normal force on the braking sur-\\nfaces. The deceleration during this range of speed\\nimmediately after touchdown may suffer, and it will be\\nmore likely that a tire can be blown out from braking at\\nthis point.\\nThe most critical conditions of landing performance\\nare the result of some combination of high gross\\nweight, high density altitude, and unfavorable wind.\\nThese conditions produce the greatest landing distance\\nand provide critical levels of energy dissipation\\nrequired of the brakes. In all cases, it is necessary to\\nmake an accurate prediction of minimum landing\\ndistance to compare with the available runway.

Engineers record the flight data and create\\nperformance charts based on the behavior of the\\nairplane during the test flights. By using these\\nperformance charts, a pilot can determine the\\nrunway length needed to take off and land, the\\namount of fuel that will be used during flight,\\nand the length of time it will take to arrive at the\\ndestination. It is important to remember that the\\ndata from the charts will not be accurate if the\\nairplane is not in good working order or when\\noperating under adverse conditions. So take into\\nconsideration that it is necessary to compensate\\nthe performance numbers if the airplane is not in\\ngood working order or piloting skills are below\\naverage.

Carefully follow that line to\\nthe right until it is under the correct temperature column\\nof 30°C. The ground roll total reads 1,325 feet and the\\ntotal required to clear a 50-foot obstacle is 2,480 feet. At\\nthis point, there are 18 knots of headwind. Reading in\\nthe notes section under point number two, it says to\\ndecrease the distances by 10 percent for each 9 knots of\\nheadwind. With 18 knots of headwind, it is necessary to\\ndecrease the distance by 20 percent. Multiply 1,325 feet\\nby 20 percent or by .20 (1325 x .20 = 265), then subtract\\nthat amount from the total distance (1325 – 265 = 1060).\\nRepeat this process for the total distance over a 50-foot\\nobstacle. The ground roll distance is 1,060 feet and the\\ntotal distance over a 50-foot obstacle is 1,984 feet.\\nCLIMB AND CRUISE CHARTS\\nClimb and cruise chart information is based on actual\\nflight tests conducted in an airplane of the same type.\\nThis information is extremely useful when planning a\\ncross-country to predict the performance and fuel\\nconsumption of the airplane. Manufacturers produce\\nseveral different charts for climb and cruise perform-\\nance. These charts will include everything from fuel,\\ntime, and distance to climb, to best power setting\\nduring cruise, to cruise range performance.\\nThe first chart to check for climb performance is a fuel,\\ntime, and distance-to-climb chart. This chart will give\\nthe fuel amount used during the climb, the time it will\\ntake to accomplish the climb, and the ground distance\\nthat will be covered during the climb. To use this chart,\\nobtain the information for the departing airport and for\\nthe cruise altitude. Using figure 9-26, calculate the fuel,\\ntime, and distance to climb based on the information\\nprovided.\\nSample Problem 4\\nDeparting Airport Pressure Altitude..............6,000 feet\\nDeparting Airport OAT..........................................25°C\\nCruise Pressure Altitude..............................10,000 feet\\nCruise OAT............................................................10°C\\nFirst, find the information for the departing airport.\\nFind the OAT for the departing airport along the bot-\\ntom, left-hand side of the graph.

The weight must be recalculated to compen-\\nsate for the fuel that was used during the flight.\\nSample Problem 11\\nPressure Altitude............................................1,250 feet\\nTemperature.....................................................Standard\\nRefer to figure 9-33.

Takeoff Distance\\nThe distance required to complete an all-engines\\noperative takeoff to the 35-foot height. It must be\\nat least 15 percent less than the distance required\\nfor a one-engine inoperative engine takeoff. This\\ndistance is not normally a limiting factor as it is\\nusually less than the one-engine inoperative take-\\noff distance.\\nThese three required takeoff runway considerations are\\nshown in figure 9-36.\\nBALANCED FIELD LENGTH\\nIn most cases, the pilot will be working with a per-\\nformance chart for takeoff runway required, which will\\ngive “balanced field length” information.

The V\\nREF speed, or threshold speed, is\\nused as a reference speed throughout the traffic pattern\\nor instrument approach as in the following example:\\nV\\nREF plus 30K .......Downwind or procedure turn\\nVREF plus 20K .......Base leg or final course inbound to\\nfinal fix\\nVREF plus 10K .......Final or final course inbound from \\nfix (ILS final)\\nVREF .......................Speed at the 50-foot height above \\nthe threshold\\nLANDING REQUIREMENTS\\nThe maximum landing weight of an airplane can be\\nrestricted by either the approach climb requirements or\\nby the landing runway available.\\nAPPROACH CLIMB REQUIREMENTS\\nThe approach climb is usually more limiting (or more\\ndifficult to meet) than the landing climb, primarily\\nbecause it is based upon the ability to execute a missed\\napproach with one engine inoperative. The required\\nclimb gradient can be affected by pressure altitude and\\ntemperature and, as in the second segment climb in the\\ntakeoff, airplane weight must be limited as needed in\\norder to comply with this climb requirement.\\nLANDING RUNWAY REQUIRED\\nThe runway distance needed for landing can be\\naffected by the following:\\n• Pressure altitude\\n• Temperature\\n• Headwind component\\n• Runway gradient or slope\\n• Airplane weight\\nIn computing the landing distance required, some man-\\nufacturers do not include all of the above items in their\\ncharts, since the regulations state that only pressure\\naltitude, wind, and airplane weight must be considered.\\nCharts are provided for anti-skid on and anti-skid off\\nconditions, but the use of reverse thrust is not used in\\ncomputing required landing distances.\\nThe landing distance, as required by the regulations, is\\nthat distance needed to land and come to a complete\\nstop from a point 50 feet above the threshold end of the\\nrunway. It includes the air distance required to travel\\nfrom the 50-foot height to touchdown (which can con-\\nsume 1,000 feet of runway distance), plus the stopping\\nSpeed Definition\\nVSO Stalling speed or the minimum \\nsteady flight speed in the landing \\nconfiguration.\\nVREF 1.3 times the stalling speed in the \\nlanding configuration. This is the \\nrequired speed at the 50-foot height \\nabove the threshold end of the run-\\nway.\\nThe approach climb speed is the \\nspeed which would give the best \\nclimb performance in the approach \\nconfiguration, with one engine inop-\\nerative, and with maximum takeoff \\npower on the operating engine(s). \\nThe required gradient of climb in this\\nconfiguration is 2.1 percent for two-\\nengine airplanes, 2.4 percent for \\nthree-engine airplanes, and 2.7 per-\\ncent for four-engine airplanes.\\nThis speed would give the best per-\\nformance in the full landing configu-\\nration with maximum takeoff power \\non all engines.

This is all that is\\nrequired for 14 CFR part 91 operators (non-air carrier),\\nand all that is shown on some landing distance required\\ncharts.\\nFor air carriers and other commercial operators sub-\\njected to 14 CFR part 121, a different set of rules\\napplies which states that the required landing distance\\nfrom the 50-foot height cannot exceed 60 percent of\\nthe actual runway length available. In all cases, the\\nminimum airspeed allowed at the 50-foot height must\\nbe no less than 1.3 times the airplane’s stalling speed in\\nthe landing configuration. This speed is commonly\\ncalled the airplane’s VREF speed and will vary with\\nlanding weight. Figure 9-40 is a diagram of these land-\\ning runway requirements.\\nSUMMARY OF LANDING REQUIREMENTS\\nIn order to establish the allowable landing weight for a\\ntransport category airplane, the following details must\\nbe considered:\\n• Airfield pressure altitude\\n• Temperature\\n• Headwind component\\n• Runway length\\n• Runway gradient or slope\\n• Runway surface condition\\nWith these details, it is possible to establish the maxi-\\nmum allowable landing weight, which will be the\\nlower of the weights as dictated by:\\n• Landing runway requirements\\n• Approach climb requirements\\nIn practice, the approach climb limitations (ability to\\nclimb in approach configuration with one engine\\ninoperative) are seldom encountered because the\\nlanding weights upon arrival at the destination airport\\nare usually light. However, as in the second segment\\nclimb requirement for takeoff, this approach climb\\ngradient must be met and landing weights must be\\nrestricted if necessary. The most likely conditions that\\nwould make the approach climb critical would be the\\nlandings at high weights and high-pressure altitudes\\nand temperatures, which might be encountered if a\\nlanding were required shortly after takeoff.\\nLanding field requirements can more frequently limit\\nan airplane’s allowable landing weight than the\\napproach climb limitations. Again, however, unless the\\nrunway is particularly short, this is seldom problemat-\\nical as the average landing weight at the destination\\nseldom approaches the maximum design landing\\nweight due to fuel burn off.\\nComplete\\nStop\\nRequired Landing Distance 14 CFR part 91 40% of Runway Length\\nRequired Landing Runway Length 14 CFR part 121\\n50'\\n1.3 V\\nS0\\nVS0 Approach\\nFigure 9-40.

Inside\\nthe troposphere, the temperature decreases at a rate of\\nabout 2° Celsius every 1,000 feet of altitude gain, and\\nthe pressure decreases at a rate of about 1 inch per\\n1,000 feet of altitude gain. At the top of the troposphere\\nis a boundary known as the tropopause , which traps\\nmoisture, and the associated weather, in the \\ntroposphere. The altitude of the tropopause varies with\\nlatitude and with the season of the year; therefore, it\\ntakes on an elliptical shape, as opposed to round.\\nLocation of the tropopause is important because it is\\ncommonly associated with the location of the \\njetstream and possible clear air turbulence.\\nThe atmospheric level above the tropopause is the\\nstratosphere, which extends from the tropopause to a\\nheight of about 160,000 feet (50 km). Little weather\\nexists in this layer and the air remains stable. At the top\\nof the stratosphere is another boundary known as the\\nstratopause, which exists at approximately 160,000\\nfeet. Directly above this is the mesosphere , which\\nextends to the mesopause boundary at about 280,000\\nfeet (85 km). The temperature in the mesosphere\\ndecreases rapidly with an increase in altitude and can\\nbe as cold as –90°C. The last layer of the atmosphere is\\nthe thermosphere. It starts above the mesosphere and\\ngradually fades into outer space.\\nOXYGEN AND THE HUMAN BODY\\nAs discussed earlier, nitrogen and other trace gases\\nmake up 79 percent of the atmosphere, while the\\nremaining 21 percent is life sustaining, atmospheric\\noxygen. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is great\\nenough to support normal growth, activity, and life. At\\n18,000 feet, however, the partial pressure of oxygen is\\nsignificantly reduced to the point that it adversely\\naffects the normal activities and functioning of the\\nhuman body. In fact, the reactions of the average \\nperson begin to be impaired at an altitude of about\\n10,000 feet and for some people as low as 5,000 feet.\\nThe physiological reactions to oxygen deprivation are\\ninsidious and affect people in different ways.

This\\nmeans a column of air 1-inch square, extending from\\nthe surface up to the upper atmospheric limit, weighs\\nabout 14.7 pounds. [Figure 10-3] A person standing at\\nsea level also experiences the pressure of the \\natmosphere; however, the pressure is not a downward\\nforce, but rather a force of pressure over the entire \\nsurface of the skin.\\nThe actual pressure at a given place and time will differ\\nwith altitude, temperature, and density of the air. These\\nconditions also affect aircraft performance, especially\\nwith regard to takeoff, rate of climb, and landings.\\nMEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nAtmospheric pressure is typically measured in inches\\nof mercury (in. Hg.) by a mercurial barometer. [Figure\\n10-4] The barometer measures the height of a column\\nof mercury inside a glass tube. A section of the mercury\\nis exposed to the pressure of the atmosphere, which\\nexerts a force on the mercury. An increase in pressure\\nforces the mercury to rise inside the tube; as pressure\\ndrops, mercury\\ndrains out of the tube, decreasing the\\nheight of the column. This type of barometer is \\ntypically used in a lab or weather observation station, is\\nnot easily transported, and is a bit difficult to read.\\nAn aneroid barometer is an alternative to a mercurial\\nbarometer; it is easier to read and transport. [Figure \\n10-5] The aneroid barometer contains a closed vessel,\\ncalled an aneroid cell, that contracts or expands with\\nchanges in pressure. The aneroid cell attaches to a \\npressure indicator with a mechanical linkage to provide\\npressure readings. The pressure sensing part of an \\naircraft altimeter is essentially an aneroid barometer. It\\nis important to note that due to the linkage mechanism\\nof an aneroid barometer, it is not as accurate as a \\nmercurial barometer.\\n14.7 lbs.\\nArea =1\\nSquare Inch\\nFigure 10-3.

These standard conditions are the\\nbasis for certain flight instruments and most airplane\\nperformance data. Standard sea level pressure is\\ndefined as 29.92 in. Hg. at 59 °F (15°C). Atmospheric\\npressure is also reported in millibars, with 1 inch of\\nmercury equaling approximately 34 millibars and \\nstandard sea level equaling 1013.2 millibars. Typical\\nmillibar pressure readings range from 950.0 to 1040.0\\nmillibars. Constant pressure charts and hurricane \\npressure reports are written using millibars.\\nSince weather stations are located around the globe, all\\nlocal barometric pressure readings are converted to a\\nsea level pressure to provide a standard for records and\\nreports. To achieve this, each station converts its \\nbarometric pressure by adding approximately 1 inch of\\nmercury for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain. For\\nexample, a station at 5,000 feet above sea level, with a\\nreading of 24.92 inches of mercury, reports a sea level\\npressure reading of 29.92 inches. [Figure 10-6] Using\\ncommon sea level pressure readings helps ensure \\naircraft altimeters are set correctly, based on the current\\npressure readings.\\nBy tracking barometric pressure trends across a large\\narea, weather forecasters can more accurately predict\\nmovement of pressure systems and the associated\\nweather.

Conversely, decreasing or\\nrapidly falling pressure usually indicates approaching\\nbad weather and possibly, severe storms.\\nEFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON ATMOSPHERIC\\nPRESSURE\\nAs altitude increases, pressure diminishes, as the\\nweight of the air column decreases. On average, with\\nevery 1,000 feet of altitude increase, the atmospheric\\npressure decreases 1 inch of mercury. This decrease in\\npressure (increase in density altitude) has a pronounced\\neffect on aircraft performance.\\nEFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON FLIGHT\\nAltitude affects every aspect of flight from aircraft \\nperformance to human performance. At higher \\naltitudes, with a decreased atmospheric pressure, \\ntakeoff and landing distances are increased, as are\\nclimb rates.\\nWhen an aircraft takes off, lift must be developed by\\nthe flow of air around the wings.

An aircraft that\\nrequires a 1,000-foot ground run at sea level will\\nrequire almost double that at an airport 5,000 feet\\nabove sea level [Figure 10-7]. It is also true that at\\nhigher altitudes, due to the decreased density of the air,\\naircraft engines and propellers are less efficient.

This, in turn, \\ncreates motion in the atmosphere, both vertically and\\nhorizontally, in the form of currents and wind. Motion\\nin the atmosphere, combined with moisture, produces\\nclouds and precipitation otherwise known as weather.\\nWIND\\nPressure and temperature changes produce two kinds\\nof motion in the atmosphere—vertical movement of\\nascending and descending currents, and horizontal\\nmovement in the form of wind. Both types of motion in\\nthe atmosphere are important as they affect the takeoff,\\nlanding, and cruise flight operations. More \\nimportant, however, is that these motions in the \\natmosphere, otherwise called atmospheric circulation,\\ncause weather changes.\\nTHE CAUSE OF ATMOSPHERIC \\nCIRCULATION\\nAtmospheric circulation is the movement of air around\\nthe surface of the Earth. It is caused by uneven heating\\nof the Earth’s surface and upsets the equilibrium of the\\natmosphere, creating changes in air movement and\\natmospheric pressure. Because the Earth has a curved\\nsurface that rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the\\nsun, the equatorial regions of the Earth receive a greater\\namount of heat from the sun than the polar regions. The\\namount of sun that heats the Earth depends upon the\\ntime of day, time of year, and the latitude of the specific\\nregion. All of these factors affect the length of time and\\nthe angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.\\nIn general circulation theory, areas of low pressure\\nexist over the equatorial regions, and areas of high\\npressure exist over the polar regions due to a difference\\nin temperature. Solar heating causes air to become less\\ndense and rise in equatorial areas. The resulting low\\npressure allows the high-pressure air at the poles to\\nflow along the planet’s surface toward the equator. As\\nthe warm air flows toward the poles, it cools, becoming\\nmore dense, and sinks back toward the surface. [Figure\\n10-8] This pattern of air circulation is correct in theory;\\nhowever, the circulation of air is modified by several\\nforces, most importantly the rotation of the Earth.\\nThe force created by the rotation of the Earth is known\\nas Coriolis force. This force is not perceptible to us as\\nwe walk around because we move so slowly and travel\\nrelatively short distances compared to the size and \\nrotation rate of the Earth. However, it does significantly\\naffect bodies that move over great distances, such as an\\nTAKEOFF DISTANCE\\n0°C0°C PRESS\\nALT\\nFT\\nPRESS\\nALT\\nFT\\nGRND\\nROLL\\nFT\\nGRND\\nROLL\\nFT\\nTOTAL FT\\nTO CLEAR\\n50 FT OBS\\nTOTAL FT\\nTO CLEAR\\n50 FT OBS\\n5000 1185 2125\\n6000 1305 2360\\n7000 1440 2635\\n8000 1590 2960\\nS.L. 745 1320\\n1000 815 1445\\n2000 895 1585 \\n3000 980 1740\\n4000 1075 1920 \\n1590 ft.\\n745 ft.\\nPressure Altitude:\\n8,000 ft. \\nPressure Altitude:\\nSea Level\\nFigure 10-7.

The Coriolis force deflects\\nair to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing it\\nto follow a curved path instead of a straight line. The\\namount of deflection differs depending on the latitude.\\nIt is greatest at the poles, and diminishes to zero at the\\nequator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs\\nwith the speed of the moving body—the faster the\\nspeed, the greater the deviation. In the Northern\\nHemisphere, the rotation of the Earth deflects moving\\nair to the right and changes the general circulation \\npattern of the air.\\nThe speed of the Earth’s rotation causes the general\\nflow to break up into three distinct cells in each \\nhemisphere. [Figure 10-9] In the Northern Hemisphere,\\nthe warm air at the equator rises upward from the \\nsurface, travels northward, and is deflected eastward\\nby the rotation of the Earth. By the time it has traveled\\none-third of the distance from the equator to the North\\nPole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward.\\nThis air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at about 30 °\\nlatitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks\\ntoward the surface. Then it flows southward along the\\nsurface back toward the equator. Coriolis force bends\\nthe flow to the right, thus creating the northeasterly\\ntrade winds that prevail from 30 ° latitude to the \\nequator. Similar forces create circulation cells that\\nencircle the Earth between 30 ° and 60° latitude, and\\nbetween 60 ° and the poles. This circulation pattern\\nresults in the prevailing westerly winds in the \\nconterminous United States.\\nCirculation patterns are further complicated by \\nseasonal changes, differences between the surfaces of\\ncontinents and oceans, and other factors.\\nFrictional forces caused by the topography of the\\nEarth’s surface modify the movement of the air in the\\natmosphere. Within 2,000 feet of the ground, the \\nfriction between the surface and the atmosphere slows\\nthe moving air. The wind is diverted from its path\\nbecause the frictional force reduces the Coriolis force.\\nThis is why the wind direction at the surface varies\\nsomewhat from the wind direction just a few thousand\\nfeet above the Earth.\\nWIND PATTERNS\\nAir flows from areas of high pressure into those of low\\npressure because air always seeks out lower pressure.\\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, this flow of air from areas\\nof high to low pressure is deflected to the right; \\nproducing a clockwise circulation around an area of\\nhigh pressure. This is also known as anti-cyclonic \\ncirculation. The opposite is true of low-pressure areas;\\nthe air flows toward a low and is deflected to create a\\ncounter-clockwise or cyclonic circulation. [Figure \\n10-10]\\nHigh-pressure systems are generally areas of dry, \\nstable, descending air. Good weather is typically \\nassociated with high-pressure systems for this reason.\\nConversely, air flows into a low-pressure area to\\nreplace rising air. This air tends to be unstable, and \\nusually brings increasing cloudiness and precipitation.\\nThus, bad weather is commonly associated with areas\\nof low pressure.\\nA good understanding of high- and low-pressure wind\\npatterns can be of great help when planning a flight,\\nbecause a pilot can take advantage of beneficial \\ntailwinds.

Typically, these turbulent conditions can\\nbe avoided by flying at higher altitudes, even above\\ncumulus cloud layers. [Figure 10-12]\\nConvective currents are particularly noticeable in areas\\nwith a landmass directly adjacent to a large body of\\nwater, such as an ocean, large lake, or other appreciable\\narea of water. During the day, land heats faster than\\nwater, so the air over the land becomes warmer and less\\ndense. It rises and is replaced by cooler, denser air\\nflowing in from over the water. This causes an onshore\\nwind, called a sea breeze .  Conversely, at night land\\ncools faster than water, as does the corresponding air.\\nIn this case, the warmer air over the water rises and is\\nreplaced by the cooler, denser air from the land,\\ncreating an offshore wind called a land breeze .

While wind shear can occur at any \\naltitude, low-level wind shear is especially hazardous\\ndue to the proximity of an aircraft to the ground.\\nDirectional wind changes of 180°and speed changes of\\n50 knots or more are associated with low-level wind\\nshear. Low-level wind shear is commonly associated\\nwith passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, and \\ntemperature inversions with strong upper level winds\\n(greater than 25 knots).\\nWind shear is dangerous to an aircraft for several \\nreasons. The rapid changes in wind direction and \\nvelocity changes the wind’s relation to the aircraft \\ndisrupting the normal flight attitude and performance\\nof the aircraft. During a wind shear situation, the effects\\ncan be subtle or very dramatic depending on windspeed\\nand direction of change.

This system is known as the low-level\\nwind shear alert system, or LLWAS.\\nIt is important to remember that wind shear can affect\\nany flight and any pilot at any altitude. While wind\\nshear may be reported, it often remains undetected and\\nis a silent danger to aviation. Always be alert to the \\npossibility of wind shear, especially when flying in and\\naround thunderstorms and frontal systems.\\nWIND AND PRESSURE REPRESENTATION\\nON SURFACE WEATHER MAPS\\nSurface weather maps provide information about\\nfronts, areas of high and low pressure, and surface\\nwinds and pressures for each station. This type of\\nweather map allows pilots to see the locations of fronts\\nand pressure systems, but more importantly, it depicts\\nthe wind and pressure at the surface for each location.\\nFor more information on surface analysis and weather\\ndepiction charts see Chapter 11.\\nWind conditions are reported by an arrow attached to\\nthe station location circle. [Figure 10-18] The station\\ncircle represents the head of the arrow, with the arrow\\npointing in the direction from which the wind is \\nblowing. Winds are described by the direction from\\nwhich they blow, thus a northwest wind means that the\\nwind is blowing from the northwest toward the \\nsoutheast. The speed of the wind is depicted by barbs\\nor pennants placed on the wind line. Each barb \\nrepresents a speed of 10 knots, while half a barb is\\nequal to 5 knots and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.\\nThe pressure for each station is recorded on the weather\\nchart and is shown in millibars. Isobars are lines drawn\\non the chart to depict areas of equal pressure. These\\nlines result in a pattern that reveals the pressure \\ngradient or change in pressure over distance. [Figure\\n10-19] Isobars are similar to contour lines on a \\ntopographic map that indicate terrain altitudes and\\nslope steepness. For example, isobars that are closely\\nspaced indicate a steep wind gradient and strong winds\\nprevail. Shallow gradients, on the other hand, are \\nrepresented by isobars that are spaced far apart, and are\\nindicative of light winds. Isobars help identify low- and\\nhigh-pressure systems as well as the location of ridges,\\ntroughs, and cols. A high is an area of high pressure\\nStrong Downdraft\\nIncreasing Headwind Increasing Tailwind\\nOutflow Outflow\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nFigure 10-17.

A ridge is an\\nelongated area of high pressure, and a trough is an \\nelongated area of low pressure. A col is the intersection\\nbetween a ridge and a trough, or an area of neutrality\\nbetween two highs or two lows.\\nIsobars furnish valuable information about winds in the\\nfirst few thousand feet above the surface. Close to the\\nground, wind direction is modified by the surface and\\nwindspeed decreases due to friction with the \\nsurface. At levels 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the \\nsurface, however, the speed is greater and the direction\\nbecomes more parallel to the isobars. Therefore, the\\nsurface winds are shown on the weather map as well as\\nthe winds at a slightly higher altitude.\\nGenerally, the wind 2,000 feet above the ground will be\\n20° to 40° to the right of surface winds, and the wind-\\nspeed will be greater. The change of wind direction is\\ngreatest over rough terrain and least over flat surfaces,\\nsuch as open water. In the absence of winds aloft \\ninformation, this rule of thumb allows for a rough \\nestimate of the wind conditions a few thousand feet\\nabove the surface.\\nATMOSPHERIC STABILITY\\nThe stability of the atmosphere depends on its ability to\\nresist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes \\nvertical movement difficult, and small vertical \\ndisturbances dampen out and disappear. In an unstable\\natmosphere, small vertical air movements tend to\\nbecome larger, resulting in turbulent airflow and \\nconvective activity. Instability can lead to significant\\nturbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe\\nweather. \\nRising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air\\npressure as altitude increases. The opposite is true of\\ndescending air; as atmospheric pressure increases, the\\ntemperature of descending air increases as it is \\ncompressed. Adiabatic heating, or adiabatic cooling,\\nare the terms used to describe this temperature change. \\nThe adiabatic process takes place in all upward and\\ndownward moving air. When air rises into an area of\\nlower pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the\\nmolecules of air expand, the temperature of the air \\nlowers. As a result, when a parcel of air rises, pressure\\ndecreases, volume increases, and temperature\\ndecreases. When air descends, the opposite is true. The\\nrate at which temperature decreases with an increase in\\naltitude is referred to as its lapse rate. As air ascends\\nthrough the atmosphere, the average rate of \\ntemperature change is 2°C (3.5°F) per 1,000 feet. \\nSince water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases\\nair density, causing it to rise. Conversely, as moisture\\ndecreases, air becomes denser and tends to sink. Since\\nmoist air cools at a slower rate, it is generally less sta-\\nble than dry air since the moist air must rise higher\\nbefore its temperature cools to that of the surrounding\\nair. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (unsaturated air) is 3°C\\n(5.4°F) per 1,000 feet. The moist adiabatic lapse rate\\nvaries from 1.1°C to 2.8°C (2°F to 5°F) per 1,000 feet. \\nThe combination of moisture and temperature \\ndetermine the stability of the air and the resulting\\nweather. Cool, dry air is very stable and resists vertical\\nmovement, which leads to good and generally clear\\nweather. The greatest instability occurs when the air is\\nmoist and warm, as it is in the tropical regions in the\\nsummer. Typically, thunderstorms appear on a daily\\nbasis in these regions due to the instability of the \\nsurrounding air.\\nIsobars\\nClosely spaced isobars mean\\na steep pressure gradient and\\nstrong winds.\\n552\\n558\\n564\\n570\\n576\\n582\\nWidely spaced isobars\\nmean a shallow pressure\\ngradient and relatively\\nlight winds.\\nFigure 10-19.

There is an atmospheric \\nanomaly that can occur, however, that changes this \\ntypical pattern of atmospheric behavior. When the \\ntemperature of the air rises with altitude, a temperature\\ninversion exists. Inversion layers are commonly \\nshallow layers of smooth, stable air close to the ground.\\nThe temperature of the air increases with altitude to a\\ncertain point, which is the top of the inversion. The air\\nat the top of the layer acts as a lid, keeping weather and\\npollutants trapped below. If the relative humidity of the\\nair is high, it can contribute to the formation of clouds,\\nfog, haze, or smoke, resulting in diminished visibility\\nin the inversion layer.\\nSurface based temperature inversions occur on clear,\\ncool nights when the air close to the ground is cooled\\nby the lowering temperature of the ground. The air\\nwithin a few hundred feet of the surface becomes\\ncooler than the air above it. Frontal inversions occur\\nwhen warm air spreads over a layer of cooler air, or\\ncooler air is forced under a layer of warmer air.\\nMOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE\\nThe atmosphere, by nature, contains moisture in the\\nform of water vapor. The amount of moisture present in\\nthe atmosphere is dependent upon the temperature of\\nthe air. Every 20°F increase in temperature doubles the\\namount of moisture the air can hold. Conversely, a\\ndecrease of 20°F cuts the capacity in half.\\nWater is present in the atmosphere in three states: \\nliquid, solid, and gaseous. All three forms can readily\\nchange to another, and all are present within the \\ntemperature ranges of the atmosphere. As water\\nchanges from one state to another, an exchange of heat\\ntakes place. These changes occur through the processes\\nof evaporation , sublimation , condensation ,\\ndeposition, melting, or freezing. However, water vapor\\nis added into the atmosphere only by the processes of\\nevaporation and sublimation.\\nEvaporation is the changing of liquid water to water\\nvapor. As water vapor forms, it absorbs heat from the\\nnearest available source. This heat exchange is known\\nas the latent heat of evaporation. A good example of\\nthis is when the body’s perspiration evaporates. The net\\neffect is a cooling sensation as heat is extracted from\\nthe body. Similarly, sublimation is the changing of ice\\ndirectly to water vapor, completely bypassing the \\nliquid stage. Though dry ice is not made of water, but\\nrather carbon dioxide, it demonstrates the principle of\\nsublimation, when a solid turns directly into vapor.\\nRELATIVE HUMIDITY\\nHumidity refers to the amount of water vapor present\\nin the atmosphere at a given time. Relative humidity is\\nthe actual amount of moisture in the air compared to\\nthe total amount of moisture the air could hold at that\\ntemperature. For example, if the current relative\\nhumidity is 65 percent, the air is holding 65 percent of\\nthe total amount of moisture that it is capable of \\nholding at that temperature and pressure. While much\\nof the western United States rarely sees days of high\\nhumidity, relative humidity readings of 75 to 90 \\npercent are not uncommon in the southern United\\nStates during warmer months. [Figure 10-20]\\nTEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT RELATIONSHIP\\nThe relationship between dewpoint and temperature\\ndefines the concept of relative humidity. The dewpoint,\\ngiven in degrees, is the temperature at which the air can\\nhold no more moisture. When the temperature of the\\nair is reduced to the dewpoint, the air is completely \\nsaturated and moisture begins to condense out of the\\nair in the form of fog, dew, frost, clouds, rain, hail, or\\nsnow.\\nAs moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the\\naltitude where temperature and dewpoint reach the\\nsame value. When lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate\\nof 5.4°F per 1,000 feet and the dewpoint temperature\\ndecreases at a rate of 1°F per 1,000 feet. This results in\\na convergence of temperature and dewpoint at a rate of\\n4.4°F. Apply the convergence rate to the reported \\ntemperature and dewpoint to determine the height of\\nthe cloud base.\\nGiven:\\nTemperature (T) = 85°F\\nDewpoint (DP) = 71°F\\nConvergence Rate (CR) = 4.4°\\nT – DP = Temperature Dewpoint Spread (TDS)\\nTDS ÷CR = X \\nX ×1,000 feet = height of cloud base AGL\\nExample:\\n85ºF – 71ºF = 14ºF\\n14ºF ÷4.4°F = 3.18\\n3.18 ×1,000 = 3,180 feet AGL\\nThe height of the cloud base is 3,180 feet AGL.\\nInversion—An increase in temperature with altitude.\\nEvaporation—The transformation of a liquid to a gaseous state, such as\\nthe change of water to water vapor.\\nSublimation\\uf8e7Process by which a solid is changed to a gas without going\\nthrough the liquid state.\\nCondensation\\uf8e7A change of state of water from a gas (water vapor) to a\\nliquid.\\nDeposition\\uf8e7The direct transformation of a gas to a solid state, in which\\nthe liquid state is bypassed.

Divide the temperature dewpoint spread by the\\nconvergence rate of 4.4 °F, and multiply by 1,000 to\\ndetermine the approximate height of the cloud base.\\nMETHODS BY WHICH AIR REACHES THE\\nSATURATION POINT\\nIf air reaches the saturation point while temperature\\nand dewpoint are close together, it is highly likely that\\nfog, low clouds, and precipitation will form. There are\\nfour methods by which air can reach the complete \\nsaturation point. First, when warm air moves over a\\ncold surface, the air’s temperature drops and reaches\\nthe saturation point. Second, the saturation point may\\nbe reached when cold air and warm air mix. Third,\\nwhen air cools at night through contact with the cooler\\nground, air reaches its saturation point. The fourth\\nmethod occurs when air is lifted or is forced upward in\\nthe atmosphere.\\nAs air rises, it uses heat energy to expand. As a result,\\nthe rising air loses heat rapidly. Unsaturated air loses\\nheat at a rate of 3.0 °C (5.4°F) for every 1,000 feet of\\naltitude gain. No matter what causes the air to reach its\\nsaturation point, saturated air brings clouds, rain, and\\nother critical weather situations.\\nDEW AND FROST\\nOn cool, calm nights, the temperature of the ground\\nand objects on the surface can cause temperatures of\\nthe surrounding air to drop below the dewpoint. When\\nthis occurs, the moisture in the air condenses and\\ndeposits itself on the ground, buildings, and other\\nobjects like cars and aircraft. This moisture is known as\\ndew and sometimes can be seen on grass in the \\nmorning. If the temperature is below freezing, the\\nmoisture will be deposited in the form of frost. While\\ndew poses no threat to an aircraft, frost poses a definite\\nflight safety hazard. Frost disrupts the flow of air over\\nthe wing and can drastically reduce the production of\\nlift. It also increases drag, which, when combined with\\nlowered lift production, can eliminate the ability to take\\noff. An aircraft must be thoroughly cleaned and free of\\nfrost prior to beginning a flight.\\nFOG\\nFog, by definition, is a cloud that begins within 50 feet\\nof the surface. It typically occurs when the temperature\\nof air near the ground is cooled to the air’s dewpoint.\\nA cubic meter of air with 17g of water vapor\\nat 20°C is at saturation, or 100% relative\\nhumidity. Any further cooling will cause\\ncondensation (fog, clouds, dew) to form.\\nThus, 20°C is the dewpoint for this situation.\\nIf the temperature is lowered\\nto 10°C, the air can only hold\\n9g of water vapor, and 8g of\\nwater will condense as water\\ndroplets. The relative humidity\\nwill still be at 100%.\\nIf the same cubic meter of air warms\\nto 30°C, the 17g of water vapor will \\nproduce a relative humidity of 56%.\\n(17g is 56% of the 30g the air could \\nhold at this temperature.)\\nC\\nC\\nC\\nFigure 10-20.

Fog is classified\\naccording to the manner in which it forms and is\\ndependent upon the current temperature and the\\namount of water vapor in the air.\\nOn clear nights, with relatively little to no wind \\npresent, radiation fog may develop. [Figure 10-21]\\nUsually, it forms in low-lying areas like mountain \\nvalleys. This type of fog occurs when the ground cools\\nrapidly due to terrestrial radiation, and the surrounding\\nair temperature reaches its dewpoint. As the sun rises\\nand the temperature increases, radiation fog will lift\\nand eventually burn off. Any increase in wind will also\\nspeed the dissipation of radiation fog. If radiation fog is\\nless than 20 feet thick, it is known as ground fog.\\nWhen a layer of warm, moist air moves over a cold \\nsurface, advection fog is likely to occur. Unlike \\nradiation fog, wind is required to form advection fog.\\nWinds of up to 15 knots allow the fog to form and\\nintensify; above a speed of 15 knots, the fog usually\\nlifts and forms low stratus clouds. Advection fog is\\ncommon in coastal areas where sea breezes can blow\\nthe air over cooler landmasses.\\nIn these same coastal areas, upslope fog is likely as\\nwell. Upslope fog occurs when moist, stable air is\\nforced up sloping land features like a mountain range.\\nThis type of fog also requires wind for formation and\\ncontinued existence. Upslope and advection fog, unlike\\nradiation fog, may not burn off with the morning sun,\\nbut instead can persist for days. They also can extend\\nto greater heights than radiation fog.\\nSteam fog, or sea smoke, forms when cold, dry air\\nmoves over warm water. As the water evaporates, it\\nrises and resembles smoke. This type of fog is common\\nover bodies of water during the coldest times of the\\nyear. Low-level turbulence and icing are commonly\\nassociated with steam fog.\\nIce fog occurs in cold weather when the temperature is\\nmuch below freezing and water vapor forms directly\\ninto ice crystals. Conditions favorable for its formation\\nare the same as for radiation fog except for cold \\ntemperature, usually –25°F or colder. It occurs mostly\\nin the arctic regions, but is not unknown in middle \\nlatitudes during the cold season.\\nCLOUDS\\nClouds are visible indicators and are often indicative of\\nfuture weather. For clouds to form, there must be \\nadequate water vapor and condensation nuclei, as well\\nas a method by which the air can be cooled. When the\\nair cools and reaches its saturation point, the invisible\\nwater vapor changes into a visible state. Through the\\nprocesses of deposition (also referred to as \\nsublimation) and condensation, moisture condenses or\\nsublimates onto miniscule particles of matter like dust,\\nsalt, and smoke known as condensation nuclei . The\\nnuclei are important because they provide a means for\\nthe moisture to change from one state to another.\\nCloud type is determined by its height, shape, and\\nbehavior. They are classified according to the height of\\ntheir bases as low, middle, or high clouds, as well as\\nclouds with vertical development. [Figure 10-22]\\nLow clouds are those that form near the Earth’s surface\\nand extend up to 6,500 feet AGL. They are made \\nprimarily of water droplets, but can include \\nsupercooled water droplets that induce hazardous \\naircraft icing. Typical low clouds are stratus, \\nstratocumulus, and nimbostratus. Fog is also classified\\nas a type of low cloud formation. Clouds in this family\\ncreate low ceilings, hamper visibility, and can change\\nrapidly. Because of this, they influence flight planning\\nand can make VFR flight impossible.\\nMiddle clouds form around 6,500 feet AGL and extend\\nup to 20,000 feet AGL. They are composed of water,\\nice crystals, and supercooled water droplets. Typical\\nmiddle-level clouds include altostratus and \\naltocumulus. These types of clouds may be \\nencountered on cross-country flights at higher \\naltitudes. Altostratus clouds can produce turbulence\\nand may contain moderate icing.

Cumulonimbus clouds that\\nform in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands of \\nthunderstorms or squall lines.\\nSince rising air currents cause cumulonimbus clouds,\\nthey are extremely turbulent and pose a significant \\nhazard to flight safety. For example, if an aircraft enters\\na thunderstorm, the aircraft could experience updrafts\\nand downdrafts that exceed 3,000 feet per minute. In\\naddition, thunderstorms can produce large hailstones,\\ndamaging lightning, tornadoes, and large quantities of\\nwater, all of which are potentially hazardous to aircraft.\\nA thunderstorm makes its way through three distinct\\nstages before dissipating. It begins with the cumulus\\nstage, in which lifting action of the air begins. If \\nsufficient moisture and instability are present, the\\nclouds continue to increase in vertical height.\\nContinuous, strong updrafts prohibit moisture from\\nfalling. The updraft region grows larger than the \\nindividual thermals feeding the storm. Within \\napproximately 15 minutes, the thunderstorm reaches\\nthe mature stage, which is the most violent time period\\nof the thunderstorm’s life cycle. At this point, drops of\\nmoisture, whether rain or ice, are too heavy for the\\ncloud to support and begin falling in the form of rain or\\nhail. This creates a downward motion of the air. Warm,\\nrising air; cool, precipitation-induced descending air;\\nand violent turbulence all exist within and near the\\ncloud.

Visibility refers to the greatest\\nhorizontal distance at which prominent objects can be\\nviewed with the naked eye. Current visibility is also\\nreported in METAR and other aviation weather reports,\\nas well as automated weather stations. Visibility \\ninformation, as predicted by meteorologists, is \\navailable during a preflight weather briefing.\\nPRECIPITATION\\nPrecipitation refers to any form of water particles that\\nform in the atmosphere and fall to the ground. It has a\\nprofound impact on flight safety. Depending on the\\nform of precipitation, it can reduce visibility, create\\nicing situations, and affect landing and takeoff \\nperformance of an aircraft.\\nPrecipitation occurs because water or ice particles in\\nclouds grow in size until the atmosphere can no longer\\nsupport them. It can occur in several forms as it falls\\ntoward the Earth, including drizzle, rain, ice pellets,\\nhail, and ice. \\nDrizzle is classified as very small water droplets,\\nsmaller than 0.02 inches in diameter. Drizzle usually\\naccompanies fog or low stratus clouds. Water droplets\\nof larger size are referred to as rain. Rain that falls\\nthrough the atmosphere but evaporates prior to striking\\nthe ground is known as virga. Freezing rain and \\nfreezing drizzle occur when the temperature of the \\nsurface is below freezing; the rain freezes on contact\\nwith the cooler surface.\\nIf rain falls through a temperature inversion, it may\\nfreeze as it passes through the underlying cold air and\\nfall to the ground in the form of ice pellets. Ice pellets\\nare an indication of a temperature inversion and that\\nfreezing rain exists at a higher altitude. In the case of\\nhail, freezing water droplets are carried up and down\\nby drafts inside clouds, growing larger in size as they\\ncome in contact with more moisture. Once the updrafts\\ncan no longer hold the freezing water, it falls to the\\nEarth in the form of hail. Hail can be pea-sized, or it\\ncan grow as large as 5 inches in diameter, larger than a\\nsoftball.\\nSnow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that\\nfalls at a steady rate or in snow showers that begin,\\nchange in intensity, and end rapidly. Falling snow also\\nvaries in size, being very small grains or large flakes.\\nSnow grains are the equivalent of drizzle in size.\\nPrecipitation in any form poses a threat to safety of\\nflight. Often, precipitation is accompanied by low \\nceilings and reduced visibility. Aircraft that have ice,\\nsnow, or frost on their surfaces must be carefully\\ncleaned prior to beginning a flight because of the \\npossible airflow disruption and loss of lift. Rain can\\ncontribute to water in the fuel tanks. Precipitation can\\ncreate hazards on the runway surface itself, making\\ntakeoffs and landings difficult, if not impossible, due to\\nsnow, ice, or pooling water and very slick surfaces.\\nAIR MASSES\\nAir masses are large bodies of air that take on the \\ncharacteristics of the surrounding area, or source\\nregion. A source region is typically an area in which the\\nair remains relatively stagnant for a period of days or\\nlonger. During this time of stagnation, the air mass\\ntakes on the temperature and moisture characteristics\\nof the source region. Areas of stagnation can be found\\nin polar regions, tropical oceans, and dry deserts. Air\\nmasses are classified based on their region of \\norigination:\\n• Polar or Tropical\\n• Maritime or Continental\\nA continental polar air mass forms over a polar region\\nand brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air\\nmasses form over warm tropical waters like the\\nCaribbean Sea and bring warm, moist air. As the air\\nmass moves from its source region and passes over\\nland or water, the air mass is subjected to the varying\\nconditions of the land or water, and these modify the\\nnature of the air mass. [Figure 10-24]\\nAn air mass passing over a warmer surface will be\\nwarmed from below, and convective currents form,\\ncausing the air to rise. This creates an unstable air mass\\nwith good surface visibility. Moist, unstable air causes\\ncumulus clouds, showers, and turbulence to form.\\nConversely, an air mass passing over a colder surface\\ndoes not form convective currents, but instead creates a\\nstable air mass with poor surface visibility. The poor\\nsurface visibility is due to the fact that smoke, dust, and\\nother particles cannot rise out of the air mass and are\\ninstead trapped near the surface. A stable air mass can\\nproduce low stratus clouds and fog.\\nFRONTS\\nAs air masses move across bodies of water and land,\\nthey eventually come in contact with another air mass\\nwith different characteristics. The boundary layer\\nbetween two types of air masses is known as a front.\\nAn approaching front of any type always means\\nchanges to the weather are imminent.\\nAir Mass—An extensive body of air having fairly uniform properties of\\ntemperature and moisture.\\nCh 10.qxd  10/24/03  8:12 AM  Page 10-18'),\n",

As the flight progresses westward to\\nColumbus and closer to the oncoming warm front, the\\nclouds deepen and become increasingly stratiform in\\nappearance with a ceiling of 6,000 feet. The visibility\\ndecreases to 6 miles in haze with a falling barometric\\npressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather \\ndeteriorates to broken clouds at 2,000 feet with 3 miles\\nvisibility and rain. With the temperature and dewpoint\\nthe same, fog is likely. At St. Louis, the sky is overcast\\nwith low clouds and drizzle and the visibility is 1 mile.\\nBeyond Indianapolis, the ceiling and visibility would\\nbe too low to continue VFR. Therefore, it would be\\nwise to remain in Indianapolis until the warm front had\\npassed, which might require a day or two. \\nCOLD FRONT\\nA cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and\\nstable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air.\\nCold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, \\nprogressing at a rate of 25 to 30 m.p.h. However,\\nextreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at\\nspeeds of up to 60 m.p.h. A typical cold front moves in\\na manner opposite that of a warm front; because it is so\\ndense, it stays close to the ground and acts like a \\nsnowplow, sliding under the warmer air and forcing the\\nless dense air aloft.

The type of clouds that form\\ndepends on the stability of the warmer air mass. A cold\\nfront in the Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented\\nin a northeast to southwest manner and can be several \\nhundred miles long, encompassing a large area of land.\\nPrior to the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform \\nor towering cumulus clouds are present, and \\ncumulonimbus clouds are possible. Rain showers and\\nhaze are possible due to the rapid development of\\nclouds. The wind from the south-southwest helps to\\nreplace the warm temperatures with the relative colder\\nair. A high dewpoint and falling barometric pressure\\nare indicative of imminent cold front passage.\\nAs the cold front passes, towering cumulus or \\ncumulonimbus clouds continue to dominate the sky.\\nDepending on the intensity of the cold front, heavy rain\\nshowers form and might be accompanied by lightning,\\nthunder, and/or hail. More severe cold fronts can also\\nproduce tornadoes. During cold front passage, the \\nvisibility will be poor, with winds variable and gusty,\\nand the temperature and dewpoint drop rapidly. A\\nquickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out during\\nfrontal passage, then begins a gradual increase.\\nAfter frontal passage, the towering cumulus and \\ncumulonimbus clouds begin to dissipate to cumulus\\nclouds with a corresponding decrease in the \\nprecipitation. Good visibility eventually prevails with\\nthe winds from the west-northwest. Temperatures\\nremain cooler and the barometric pressure continues to\\nrise.\\nFAST-MOVING COLD FRONT\\nFast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure\\nsystems far behind the actual front. The friction\\nbetween the ground and the cold front retards the\\nmovement of the front and creates a steeper frontal \\nsurface. This results in a very narrow band of weather,\\nconcentrated along the leading edge of the front. If the\\nwarm air being overtaken by the cold front is relatively\\nstable, overcast skies and rain may occur for some \\ndistance ahead of the front. If the warm air is unstable,\\nscattered thunderstorms and rain showers may form. A\\ncontinuous line of thunderstorms, or a squall line, may\\nform along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present a\\nserious hazard to pilots as squall type thunderstorms\\nare intense and move quickly. Behind a fast moving\\ncold front, the skies usually clear rapidly and the front\\nleaves behind gusty, turbulent winds and colder \\ntemperatures.\\nFLIGHT TOWARD AN APPROACHING COLD\\nFRONT\\nLike warm fronts, not all cold fronts are the same.\\nExamining a flight toward an approaching cold front,\\npilots can get a better understanding of the type of \\nconditions that can be encountered in flight. Figure \\n10-27 shows a flight from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\\ntoward St. Louis, Missouri.\\nAt the time of departure from Pittsburgh, the weather is\\nVFR with 3 miles visibility in smoke and a scattered\\nlayer of clouds at 3,500 feet. As the flight progresses\\nwestward to Columbus and closer to the oncoming cold\\nfront, the clouds show signs of vertical development\\nwith a broken layer at 2,500 feet. The visibility is 6\\nmiles in haze with a falling barometric pressure.\\nApproaching Indianapolis, the weather has deteriorated\\nto overcast clouds at 1,000 feet, and 3 miles visibility\\nwith thunderstorms and heavy rain showers. At St.\\nLouis, the weather gets better with scattered clouds at\\n1,000 feet and a 10 mile visibility.  \\nA pilot using sound judgment based on the knowledge\\nof frontal conditions, would most likely remain in\\nIndianapolis until the front had passed. Trying to fly\\nbelow a line of thunderstorms or a squall line is \\nhazardous and foolish, and flight over the top of or\\naround the storm is not an option. Thunderstorms can\\nextend up to well over the capability of small airplanes\\nand can extend in a line for 300 to 500 miles.\\nCOMPARISON OF COLD AND WARM FRONTS\\nWarm fronts and cold fronts are very different in nature\\nas are the hazards associated with each front. They vary\\nin speed, composition, weather phenomenon, and \\nprediction. Cold fronts, which move at 20 to 35 m.p.h.,\\nmove very quickly in comparison to warm fronts,\\nwhich move at only 10 to 25 m.p.h. Cold fronts also\\npossess a steeper frontal slope. Violent weather activity\\nis associated with cold fronts and the weather usually\\noccurs along the frontal boundary, not in advance.\\nHowever, squall lines can form during the summer\\nmonths as far as 200 miles in advance of a severe cold\\nfront. Whereas warm fronts bring low ceilings, poor\\nvisibility, and rain, cold fronts bring sudden storms,\\ngusty winds, turbulence, and sometimes hail or \\ntornadoes.\\nCold fronts are fast approaching with little or no \\nwarning, and they make a complete weather change in\\njust a few hours. The weather clears rapidly after \\npassage and drier air with unlimited visibilities prevail.\\nWarm fronts, on the other hand, provide advance \\nwarning of their approach and can take days to pass\\nthrough a region.\\nWIND SHIFTS\\nWind around a high-pressure system rotates in a \\nclockwise fashion, while low-pressure winds rotate in a\\ncounter-clockwise manner.

Fronts\\nare the boundaries between two areas of pressure, and\\ntherefore, wind shifts are continually occurring within\\na front. Shifting wind direction is most pronounced in\\nconjunction with cold fronts.\\nSTATIONARY FRONT\\nWhen the forces of two air masses are relatively equal,\\nthe boundary or front that separates them remains \\nstationary and influences the local weather for days.\\nThis front is called a stationary front . The weather\\nassociated with a stationary front is typically a mixture\\nthat can be found in both warm and cold fronts.\\nOCCLUDED FRONT\\nAn occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold\\nfront catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As\\nthe occluded front approaches, warm front weather \\nprevails, but is immediately followed by cold front\\nweather. There are two types of occluded fronts that\\ncan occur, and the temperatures of the colliding frontal\\nsystems play a large part in defining the type of front\\nand the resulting weather. A cold front occlusion occurs\\nwhen a fast-moving cold front is colder than the air\\nahead of the slow-moving warm front. When this\\noccurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the\\nwarm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the\\ncold front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found\\nin both warm and cold fronts, providing the air is \\nrelatively stable. A warm front occlusion occurs when\\nthe air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of\\nthe cold front. When this is the case, the cold front rides\\nup and over the warm front. If the air forced aloft by\\nthe warm front occlusion is unstable, the weather will\\nbe more severe than the weather found in a cold front\\nocclusion. Embedded thunderstorms, rain, and fog are\\nlikely to occur.\\nFigure 10-28 depicts a cross-section of a typical cold\\nfront occlusion. The warm front slopes over the \\nprevailing cooler air and produces the warm front type\\nweather. Prior to the passage of the typical occluded\\nfront, cirriform and stratiform clouds prevail, light to\\nheavy precipitation is falling, visibility is poor, \\ndewpoint is steady, and barometric pressure is \\nfalling. During the passage of the front, nimbostratus\\nand cumulonimbus clouds predominate, and towering\\ncumulus may also be possible. Light to heavy \\nprecipitation is falling, visibility is poor, winds are \\nvariable, and the barometric pressure is leveling off.\\nAfter the passage of the front, nimbostratus and \\naltostratus clouds are visible, precipitation is \\ndecreasing and clearing, and visibility is improving.\\nStationary Front—A boundary between two air masses that are \\nrelatively balanced.\\nOccluded Front—A frontal occlusion occurs when a fast-moving cold\\nfront catches up with a slow-moving warm front.

These reports and forecasts\\nenable pilots to make informed decisions regarding\\nweather and flight safety.\\nOBSERVATIONS\\nThe data gathered from surface and upper altitude\\nobservations form the basis of all weather forecasts,\\nadvisories, and briefings. There are three types of\\nweather observations: surface, upper air, and radar.\\nSURFACE AVIATION WEATHER \\nOBSERVATIONS\\nSurface aviation weather observations (METARs) are a\\ncompilation of weather elements of the current weather\\nat ground stations across the United States. The \\nnetwork is made up of government run facilities and \\nprivately contracted facilities that provide up-to-date\\nweather information. Automated weather sources such\\nas automated weather observing systems (AWOS)\\nand automated surface observing systems (ASOS),\\nas well as other automated facilities, also play a major\\nrole in the gathering of surface observations. \\nSurface observations provide local weather conditions\\nand other relevant information. This information\\nincludes the type of report, station identifier, date and\\ntime, modifier (as required), wind, visibility, runway\\nvisual range (RVR), weather phenomena, sky \\ncondition, temperature/dewpoint, altimeter reading,\\nand applicable remarks. The information gathered for\\nthe surface observation may be from a person, an \\nautomated station, or an automated station that is\\nupdated or enhanced by a weather observer. In any\\nform, the surface observation provides valuable \\ninformation about airports around the country.\\nUPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS\\nObservations of upper air weather prove to be more\\nchallenging than surface observations. There are only\\ntwo methods by which upper air weather phenomena\\ncan be observed: radiosonde observations and pilot\\nAutomated Weather Observing System (A WOS)—Automated weather\\nreporting system consisting of various sensors, a processor, a \\ncomputer-generated voice subsystem, and a transmitter to broadcast\\nweather data. \\nAutomated Surface Observation System (ASOS)—Weather reporting\\nsystem which provides surface observations every minute via digitized\\nvoice broadcasts and printed reports.\\nRadiosonde—A weather instrument that observes and reports \\nmeteorological conditions from the upper atmosphere. This instrument\\nis typically carried into the atmosphere by some form of weather \\nballoon.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-1'),\n",

Using radio telemetry,\\nradiosonde observations are made by sounding \\nballoons from which weather data is received twice\\ndaily. These upper air observations provide \\ntemperature, humidity, pressure, and wind data for\\nheights up to and above 100,000 feet. In addition to\\nthis, pilots provide vital information regarding upper\\nair weather observations. Pilots remain the only \\nreal-time source of information regarding turbulence,\\nicing, and cloud heights, which is gathered from pilots\\nin flight, through the filing of pilot weather reports or\\nPIREPs. Together, pilot reports and radiosonde \\nobservations provide information on upper air \\nconditions important for flight planning. Many U.S.\\nand international airlines have equipped their aircraft\\nwith instrumentation that automatically transmits \\nin-flight weather observations through the DataLink\\nsystem to the airline dispatcher who disseminates the\\ndata to appropriate weather forecasting authorities.\\nRADAR OBSERVATIONS\\nWeather observers use three types of radar to provide\\ninformation about precipitation, wind, and weather \\nsystems. The WSR-88D NEXRAD radar, commonly\\ncalled Doppler radar, provides in-depth observations\\nthat inform surrounding communities of impending\\nweather. FAA terminal doppler weather radar (TDWR),\\ninstalled at some major airports around the country,\\nalso aids in providing severe weather alerts and \\nwarnings to airport traffic controllers. Terminal radar\\nensures pilots are aware of wind shear, gust fronts, and\\nheavy precipitation, all of which are dangerous to \\narriving and departing aircraft. The third type of radar\\ncommonly used in the detection of precipitation is the\\nFAA airport surveillance radar. This radar is used \\nprimarily to detect aircraft; however, it also detects the\\nlocation and intensity of precipitation which is used to\\nroute aircraft traffic around severe weather in an airport\\nenvironment.\\nSERVICE OUTLETS\\nService outlets are government or private facilities that\\nprovide aviation weather services. Several different\\ngovernment agencies, including the Federal Aviation\\nAdministration (FAA), National Oceanic and\\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the\\nNational Weather Service (NWS) work in conjunction\\nwith private aviation companies to provide different\\nmeans of accessing weather information.\\nFAA FLIGHT SERVICE STATION\\nThe FAA Flight Service Station (FSS) is the primary\\nsource for preflight weather information. A preflight\\nweather briefing from an automated FSS (AFSS) can\\nbe obtained 24 hours a day by calling 1-800-WX\\nBRIEF almost anywhere in the U.S. In areas not served\\nby an AFSS, National Weather Service facilities may\\nprovide pilot weather briefings. Telephone numbers for\\nNWS facilities and additional numbers for\\nFSSs/AFSSs can be found in the Airport/Facility\\nDirectory (A/FD) or in the U.S. Government section of\\nthe telephone book. \\nFlight Service Stations also provide in-flight weather\\nbriefing services, as well as scheduled and unscheduled\\nweather broadcasts. An FSS may also furnish weather\\nadvisories to flights within the FSS region of authority. \\nTRANSCRIBED INFORMATION \\nBRIEFING SERVICE (TIBS)\\nThe Transcribed Information Briefing Service (TIBS)\\nis a service which is prepared and disseminated by\\nselected Automated Flight Service Stations. It provides\\ncontinuous telephone recordings of meteorological and\\naeronautical information. Specifically, TIBS provides\\narea and route briefings, airspace procedures, and \\nspecial announcements. It is designed to be a \\npreliminary briefing tool and is not intended to replace\\na standard briefing from an FSS specialist.\\nThe TIBS service is available 24 hours a day and is\\nupdated when conditions change, but it can only be\\naccessed by a TOUCH-TONE\\n\\uf6d9 phone. The phone\\nnumbers for the TIBS service are listed in the A/FD.\\nDIRECT USER ACCESS \\nTERMINAL SERVICE (DUATS)\\nThe Direct User Access Terminal Service, which is\\nfunded by the FAA, allows any pilot with a current\\nmedical certificate to access weather information and\\nfile a flight plan via computer. Two methods of access\\nare available to connect with DUATS. The first is on\\nthe Internet through DynCorp at http://www.duats.com\\nor Data Transformation Corporation at\\nhttp://www.duat.com. The second method requires a\\nmodem and a communications program supplied by a\\nDUATS provider. To access the weather information\\nand file a flight plan by this method, pilots use a toll\\nfree telephone number to connect the user’s computer\\ndirectly to the DUATS computer. The current vendors\\nof DUATS service and the associated phone numbers\\nare listed in Chapter 7 of the Aeronautical Information\\nManual (AIM).\\nENROUTE FLIGHT ADVISORY SERVICE\\nA service specifically designed to provide timely\\nenroute weather information upon pilot request is\\nknown as the enroute flight advisory service (EFAS),\\nor Flight Watch. EFAS provides a pilot with weather\\nadvisories tailored to the type of flight, route, and cruis-\\ning altitude. EFAS can be one of the best sources for\\ncurrent weather information along the route of flight. \\nA pilot can usually contact an EFAS specialist from 6\\na.m. to 10 p.m. anywhere in the conterminous U.S. and\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-2'),\n",

The common EFAS frequency, 122.0\\nMHz, is established for pilots of aircraft flying between\\n5,000 feet AGL and 17,500 feet MSL. \\nHAZARDOUS IN-FLIGHT WEATHER \\nADVISORY (HIWAS)\\nHIWAS is a national program for broadcasting haz-\\nardous weather information continuously over selected\\nnavaids. The broadcasts include advisories such as\\nAIRMETS, SIGMETS, convective SIGMETS , and\\nurgent PIREPs. These broadcasts are only a summary\\nof the information, and pilots should contact an FSS or\\nEFAS for detailed information. Navaids that have\\nHIWAS capability are depicted on sectional charts with\\nan “H” in the upper right corner of the identification\\nbox. [Figure 11-1]\\nTRANSCRIBED WEATHER BROADCAST\\n(TWEB)\\nA transcribed weather broadcast is a weather report\\ntransmitted continuously over selected navaids. On a\\nsectional chart, a “T” in the upper right-hand corner of\\nthe navaid box indicates TWEB availability. TWEB\\nweather usually consists of route-orientated data\\nincluding route forecasts, forecast outlook, winds aloft,\\nand other selected weather reports for an area within 50\\nnautical miles (NM) of the FSS or for a 50-mile wide\\ncorridor along a specific route. A TWEB forecast is\\nvalid for 12 hours and is updated four times a day.\\nWEATHER BRIEFINGS\\nPrior to every flight, pilots should gather all \\ninformation vital to the nature of the flight. This\\nincludes an appropriate weather briefing obtained from\\na specialist at an FSS, AFSS, or NWS. \\nFor weather specialists to provide an appropriate\\nweather briefing, they need to know which of the three\\ntypes of briefings is needed—a standard briefing, an\\nabbreviated briefing, or an outlook briefing. Other\\nhelpful information is whether the flight is visual flight\\nrule (VFR) or instrument flight rule (IFR), aircraft\\nidentification and type, departure point, estimated time\\nof departure (ETD), flight altitude, route of flight, \\ndestination, and estimated time en route (ETE).\\nThis information is recorded in the flight plan system,\\nand a note is made regarding the type of weather \\nbriefing provided. If necessary, it can be referenced\\nlater to file or amend a flight plan. It is also used when\\nan aircraft is overdue or is reported missing.\\nSTANDARD BRIEFING\\nA standard briefing is the most complete report and \\nprovides the overall weather picture. This type of \\nbriefing should be obtained prior to the departure of\\nany flight and should be used during flight planning. A\\nstandard briefing provides the following information in\\nsequential order if it is applicable to the route of flight.\\n1. Adverse Conditions— This includes informa-\\ntion about adverse conditions that may \\ninfluence a decision to cancel or alter the route\\nof flight. Adverse conditions includes \\nsignificant weather, such as thunderstorms or\\naircraft icing, or other important items such as\\nairport closings.\\n2. VFR Flight NOT RECOMMENDED— If\\nthe weather for the route of flight is below\\nVFR minimums, or if it is doubtful the flight\\ncould be made under VFR conditions due to\\nthe forecast weather, the briefer may state that\\nVFR is not recommended. It is the pilot’s \\ndecision whether or not to continue the flight\\nunder VFR, but this advisory should be\\nweighed carefully.\\n3. Synopsis— The synopsis is an overview of the\\nlarger weather picture. Fronts and major\\nweather systems that affect the general area\\nare provided.\\nH\\nSymbol Indicates HIWAS\\nFigure 11-1.

SIGMET criteria include severe icing, severe and\\nextreme turbulence, duststorms, sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and\\nvolcanic ash that lower visibility to less than 3 miles.\\nConvective SIGMET—A weather advisory concerning convective\\nweather significant to the safety of all aircraft. Convective SIGMETs\\nare issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, thunderstorms over a\\nwide area, embedded thunderstorms, wind gusts to 50 knots or greater,\\nand/or hail \\n3/4 inch in diameter or greater.\\nUrgent PIREP—Any pilot report that contains any of the following\\nweather phenomena: tornadoes, funnel clouds, or waterspouts; severe\\nor extreme turbulence, including clear air turbulence; severe icing; hail;\\nvolcanic ash; or low-level wind shear.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-3'),\n",

En Route Forecast— The en route forecast is\\na summary of the weather forecast for the \\nproposed route of flight.\\n6. Destination Forecast— The destination \\nforecast is a summary of the expected weather\\nfor the destination airport at the estimated time\\nof arrival (ETA).\\n7. Winds and Temperatures Aloft— Winds and\\ntemperatures aloft is a report of the winds at\\nspecific altitudes for the route of flight.\\nHowever, the temperature information is \\nprovided only on request.\\n8.

Other Information— At the end of the \\nstandard briefing, the FSS specialist will \\nprovide the radio frequencies needed to open a\\nflight plan and to contact en route flight \\nadvisory service (EFAS). Any additional \\ninformation requested is also provided at this\\ntime.\\nABBREVIATED BRIEFING\\nAn abbreviated briefing is a shortened version of the\\nstandard briefing. It should be requested when a \\ndeparture has been delayed or when specific weather\\ninformation is needed to update the previous briefing.\\nWhen this is the case, the weather specialist needs to\\nknow the time and source of the previous briefing so\\nthe necessary weather information will not be omitted\\ninadvertently.\\nOUTLOOK BRIEFING\\nAn outlook briefing should be requested when a\\nplanned departure is 6 or more hours away. It provides\\ninitial forecast information that is limited in scope due\\nto the timeframe of the planned flight. This type of\\nbriefing is a good source of flight planning information\\nthat can influence decisions regarding route of flight,\\naltitude, and ultimately the go, no-go decision. A\\nfollow-up briefing prior to departure is advisable since\\nan outlook briefing generally only contains \\ninformation based on weather trends and existing\\nweather in geographical areas at or near the departure\\nairport.\\nAVIATION WEATHER REPORTS\\nAviation weather reports are designed to give accurate\\ndepictions of current weather conditions. Each report\\nprovides current information that is updated at \\ndifferent times. Some typical reports are aviation \\nroutine weather reports (METAR), pilot weather\\nreports (PIREPs), and radar weather reports (SDs).\\nAVIATION ROUTINE WEATHER REPORT\\n(METAR)\\nAn aviation routine weather report, or METAR, is an\\nobservation of current surface weather reported in a\\nstandard international format. While the METAR code\\nhas been adopted worldwide, each country is allowed\\nto make modifications to the code. Normally, these \\ndifferences are minor but necessary to accommodate\\nlocal procedures or particular units of measure. This\\ndiscussion of METAR will cover elements used in the\\nUnited States.\\nExample:\\nMETAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26 3/4SM\\n+TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK\\nPRESFR\\nA typical METAR report contains the following \\ninformation in sequential order:\\n1. Type of Report— There are two types of\\nMETAR reports. The first is the routine\\nMETAR report that is transmitted every hour.\\nThe second is the aviation selected special\\nweather report (SPECI). This is a special\\nreport that can be given at any time to update\\nthe METAR for rapidly changing weather \\nconditions, aircraft mishaps, or other critical\\ninformation.\\n2. Station Identifier— Each station is identified\\nby a four-letter code as established by the\\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization\\n(ICAO). In the 48 contiguous states, a unique\\nthree-letter identifier is preceded by the letter\\n“K.” For example, Gregg County Airport in\\nLongview, Texas, is identified by the letters\\n“KGGG,” K being the country designation\\nand GGG being the airport identifier. In other\\nregions of the world, including Alaska and\\nHawaii, the first two letters of the four-letter\\nICAO identifier indicate the region, country,\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-4'),\n",

Alaska identifiers always begin with\\nthe letters “PA” and Hawaii identifiers always\\nbegin with the letters “PH.” A list of station\\nidentifiers can be found at an FSS or NWS\\noffice.\\n3. Date and Time of Report— The date and time\\n(161753Z ) are depicted in a six-digit group.\\nThe first two digits of the six-digit group are\\nthe date. The last four digits are the time of the\\nMETAR, which is always given in\\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC). A “Z” is\\nappended to the end of the time to denote the\\ntime is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed\\nto local time.\\n4. Modifier— Modifiers denote that the METAR\\ncame from an automated source or that the\\nreport was corrected. If the notation “AUTO”\\nis listed in the METAR, the report came from\\nan automated source. It also lists “AO1” or\\n“AO2” in the remarks section to indicate the\\ntype of precipitation sensors employed at the\\nautomated station. \\nWhen the modifier “ COR” is used, it \\nidentifies a corrected report sent out to replace\\nan earlier report that contained an error.\\nExample:\\nMETAR KGGG 161753Z COR\\n5. Wind— Winds are reported with five digits\\n(14021) unless the speed is greater than 99\\nknots, in which case the wind is reported with\\nsix digits. The first three digits indicate the\\ndirection the wind is blowing in tens of\\ndegrees. If the wind is variable, it is reported\\nas “VRB.” The last two digits indicate the\\nspeed of the wind in knots (KT) unless the\\nwind is greater than 99 knots, in which case it\\nis indicated by three digits. If the winds are\\ngusting, the letter “G” follows the windspeed\\n(G26). After the letter “G,” the peak gust\\nrecorded is provided. If the wind varies more\\nthan 60° and the windspeed is greater than 6\\nknots, a separate group of numbers, separated\\nby a “V,” will indicate the extremes of the\\nwind directions.\\n6. Visibility— The prevailing visibility (3/4 SM)\\nis reported in statute miles as denoted by the \\nletters “SM.” It is reported in both miles and\\nfractions of miles. At times, RVR, or runway\\nvisual range is reported following the \\nprevailing visibility. RVR is the distance a\\npilot can see down the runway in a moving \\naircraft. When RVR is reported, it is shown\\nwith an R, then the runway number followed\\nby a slant, then the visual range in feet. For\\nexample, when the RVR is reported as\\nR17L/1400FT, it translates to a visual range of\\n1,400 feet on runway 17 left. \\n7. Weather— Weather can be broken down into\\ntwo different categories: qualifiers and\\nweather phenomenon (+TSRA BR). First, the\\nqualifiers of intensity, proximity, and the\\ndescriptor of the weather will be given. The\\nintensity may be light (-), moderate ( ), or\\nheavy (+). Proximity only depicts weather\\nphenomena that are in the airport vicinity. The\\nnotation “VC” indicates a specific weather\\nphenomenon is in the vicinity of 5 to 10 miles\\nfrom the airport. Descriptors are used to\\ndescribe certain types of precipitation and\\nobscurations. Weather phenomena may be\\nreported as being precipitation, obscurations,\\nand other phenomena such as squalls or funnel\\nclouds. Descriptions of weather phenomena as\\nthey begin or end, and hailstone size are also\\nlisted in the remarks sections of the report.\\n[Figure 11-2]\\n8. Sky Condition— Sky condition ( BKN008\\nOVC012CB ) is always reported in the\\nsequence of amount, height, and type or \\nindefinite ceiling/height (vertical visibility).\\nThe heights of the cloud bases are reported\\nwith a three-digit number in hundreds of feet\\nabove the ground. Clouds above 12,000 feet\\nare not detected or reported by an automated\\nstation. The types of clouds, specifically \\ntowering cumulus (TCU) or cumulonimbus\\n(CB) clouds, are reported with their height.\\nContractions are used to describe the amount\\nof cloud coverage and obscuring phenomena.\\nThe amount of sky coverage is reported in\\neighths of the sky from horizon to horizon.\\n[Figure 11-3]\\n9. Temperature and Dewpoint— The air \\ntemperature and dewpoint are always given in\\ndegrees Celsius ( 18/17). Temperatures below\\n0°C are preceded by the letter “M” to indicate\\nminus.\\n10. Altimeter Setting— The altimeter setting is\\nreported as inches of mercury in a four-digit\\nnumber group (A2970). It is always preceded\\nby the letter “A.” Rising or falling pressure\\nmay also be denoted in the remarks sections as\\n“PRESRR” or “PRESFR” respectively.\\nZulu Time—A term used in aviation for coordinated universal time\\n(UTC) which places the entire world on one time standard.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-5'),\n",

Radar weather reports are\\nissued by radar stations at 35 minutes past the hour,\\nwith special reports issued as needed.\\nRadar weather reports provide information on the type,\\nintensity, and location of the echo top of the \\nprecipitation. [Figure 11-5] These reports may also\\ninclude direction and speed of the area of precipitation\\nas well as the height and base of the precipitation in\\nhundreds of feet MSL.

However, radar only detects objects in\\nthe atmosphere that are large enough to be considered\\nprecipitation. Cloud bases and tops, ceilings, and \\nvisibility are not detected by radar.\\nA typical RAREP will include:\\n• Location identifier and time of radar observation.\\n• Echo pattern:\\n1. Line (LN)—A line of precipitation\\nechoes at least 30 miles long, at least four\\ntimes as long as it is wide, and at least 25 per-\\ncent coverage within the line.\\n2. Area (AREA)—A group of echoes of\\nsimilar type and not classified as a line.\\n3.

The echo pattern for this radar report\\nindicates a line of echos covering 8/10ths of the area.\\nThunderstorms and very heavy rain showers are \\nindicated. The next set of numbers indicate the azimuth\\nthat defines the echo (86° at 40 NM and 199° at 115\\nNM). Next, the dimension of this echo is given as 20\\nnautical miles wide (10 nautical miles on either side of\\nthe line defined by the azimuth and range). The cells\\nwithin the line are moving from 240 ° at 25 knots. The\\nmaximum top of the precipitation, as determined by\\nradar and satellite, is 57,000 feet and it is located on the\\n159° radial, 65 NM out. The last line indicates the\\nintensity of the precipitation, for example in grid QM\\nthe intensity is 3 or heavy precipitation. (1 is light and\\n6 is extreme.)\\nAVIATION FORECASTS\\nObserved weather condition reports are often used in\\nthe creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of\\ndifferent forecast products are produced and designed\\nto be used in the preflight planning stage. The printed\\nforecasts that pilots need to be familiar with are the \\nterminal aerodrome forecast (TAF), aviation area \\nforecast (FA), in-flight weather advisories (SIGMET,\\nAIRMET), and the winds and temperatures aloft \\nforecast (FD).\\nTERMINAL AERODROME \\nFORECASTS (TAF)\\nA terminal aerodrome forecast is a report established\\nfor the 5 statute mile radius around an airport. TAF\\nreports are usually given for larger airports. Each TAF\\nis valid for a 24-hour time period, and is updated four\\ntimes a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The\\nTAF utilizes the same descriptors and abbreviations as\\nused in the METAR report.\\nThe terminal forecast includes the following \\ninformation in sequential order:\\n1. Type of Report— A TAF can be either a \\nroutine forecast (TAF) or an amended forecast\\n(TAF AMD).\\n2. ICAO Station Identifier— The station \\nidentifier is the same as that used in a METAR.\\n3. Date and Time of Origin— Time and date of\\nTAF origination is given in the six-number\\ncode with the first two being the date, the last\\nfour being the time. Time is always given in\\nUTC as denoted by the Z following the \\nnumber group.\\n4. Valid Period Date and Time— The valid\\nforecast time period is given by a six-digit\\nnumber group. The first two numbers indicate\\nthe date, followed by the two-digit beginning\\ntime for the valid period, and the last two \\ndigits are the ending time.\\n5. Forecast Wind— The wind direction and\\nspeed forecast are given in a five-digit number\\ngroup. The first three indicate the direction of\\nthe wind in reference to true north. The last\\ntwo digits state the windspeed in knots as\\ndenoted by the letters “KT.” Like the METAR,\\nwinds greater than 99 knots are given in three\\ndigits.\\n6. Forecast Visibility— The forecast visibility is\\ngiven in statute miles and may be in whole\\nnumbers or fractions. If the forecast is greater\\nthan 6 miles, it will be coded as “P6SM.”\\n7. Forecast Significant Weather— Weather\\nphenomenon is coded in the TAF reports in the\\nsame format as the METAR. If no significant\\nweather is expected during the forecast time\\nperiod, the denotation “NSW” will be included\\nin the “becoming” or “temporary” weather\\ngroups.\\n8. Forecast Sky Condition— Forecast sky con-\\nditions are given in the same manner as the\\nMETAR. Only cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are\\nforecast in this portion of the TAF report as\\nopposed to CBs and towering cumulus in the\\nMETAR.\\n9. Forecast Change Group— For any \\nsignificant weather change forecast  to occur\\nduring the TAF time period, the expected \\nconditions and time period are included in this\\ngroup. This information may be shown as\\nFrom (FM), Becoming (BECMG), and\\nTemporary (TEMPO). “From” is used when a\\nrapid and significant change, usually within an\\nhour, is expected. “Becoming” is used when a\\ngradual change in the weather is expected over\\na period of no more than 2 hours. “Temporary”\\nis used for temporary fluctuations of weather,\\nexpected to last for less than an hour.\\n10. Probability Forecast— The probability \\nforecast is given percentage that describes the\\nprobability of thunderstorms and precipitation\\noccurring in the coming hours. This forecast is\\nnot used for the first 6 hours of the 24-hour\\nforecast.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-9'),\n",

The information contained in an\\nAIRMET is of operational interest to all aircraft, but\\nthe weather section concerns phenomena considered\\npotentially hazardous to light aircraft and aircraft with\\nlimited operational capabilities. \\nAn AIRMET includes forecast of moderate icing, \\nmoderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30\\nknots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than\\n1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than 3 miles, and\\nextensive mountain obscurement.\\nEach AIRMET bulletin has a fixed alphanumeric \\ndesignator, numbered sequentially for easy \\nidentification, beginning with the first issuance of the\\nday. SIERRA is the AIRMET code used to denote\\ninstrument flight rules (IFR) and mountain \\nobscuration; TANGO is used to denote turbulence,\\nstrong surface winds, and low-level wind shear; and\\nZULU is used to denote icing and freezing levels.\\nExample:\\nDFWT WA 241650\\nAIRMET TANGO UPDT 3 FOR TURBC… STG\\nSFC WINDS  AND LLWS V ALID UNTIL 242000\\nAIRMET TURBC… OK TX…UPDT\\nFROM OKC TO DFW TO SAT TO MAF TO CDS\\nTO OKC OCNL MDT TURBC BLO 60 DUE TO\\nSTG AND GUSTY LOW LVL WINDS.

On this third\\nupdate, the AIRMET Tango is issued for turbulence,\\nstrong surface winds, and low-level wind shear until\\n2000 Zulu on the same day. The turbulence section of\\nthe AIRMET is an update for Oklahoma and Texas. It\\ndefines an area from Oklahoma City to Dallas, Texas,\\nto San Antonio, to Midland, Texas, to Childress, Texas,\\nto Oklahoma City that will experience occasional \\nmoderate turbulence below 6,000 feet due to strong and\\ngusty low-level winds. It also notes that these \\nconditions are forecast to continue beyond 2000 Zulu. \\nSIGNIFICANT METEOROLOGICAL \\nINFORMATION (SIGMET)\\nSIGMETs (WSs) are in-flight advisories concerning\\nnon-convective weather that is potentially hazardous to\\nall aircraft. They report weather forecasts that include\\nsevere icing not associated with thunderstorms, severe\\nor extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not\\nassociated with thunderstorms, dust storms or \\nsandstorms that lower surface or in-flight visibilities to\\nbelow 3 miles, and volcanic ash. \\nSIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid for\\n4 hours, but if the SIGMET relates to hurricanes, it is\\nvalid for 6 hours. \\nA SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier,\\nfrom November through Yankee, excluding Sierra and\\nTango. The first issuance of a SIGMET is designated as\\na UWS, or Urgent Weather SIGMET.

It is\\nConvective SIGMET number 21C, indicating that it is\\nthe 21st consecutive report issued for the central United\\nStates. This report is valid for 2 hours until 2055 Zulu\\ntime. The Convective SIGMET is for an area from\\nKansas to Oklahoma to Texas, in the vicinity of a line\\nfrom Goodland, Kansas, to Childress, Texas. No \\nsignificant thunderstorms are being reported, but a line\\nof thunderstorms will develop by 1955 Zulu time and\\nwill move eastward at a rate of 30-35 knots through\\n2055 Zulu. Hail up to 2 inches in size is possible with\\nthe developing thunderstorms. \\nWINDS AND TEMPERATURE ALOFT \\nFORECAST (FD)\\nWinds and temperatures aloft forecasts provide wind\\nand temperature forecasts for specific locations in the\\ncontiguous United States, including network locations\\nin Hawaii and Alaska. The forecasts are made twice a\\nday based on the radiosonde upper air observations\\ntaken at 0000Z and 1200Z.\\nThrough 12,000 feet are true altitudes and above\\n18,000 feet are pressure altitudes. Wind direction is\\nalways in reference to true north and windspeed is\\ngiven in knots. The temperature is given in degrees\\nCelsius. No winds are forecast when a given level is\\nwithin 1,500 feet of the station elevation. Similarly,\\ntemperatures are not forecast for any station within\\n2,500 feet of the station elevation.\\nIf the windspeed is forecast to be greater than 100 knots\\nbut less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the\\ndirection and subtracts 100 from the speed. To decode\\nthis type of data group, the reverse must be \\naccomplished. For example, when the data appears as\\n“731960,” subtract 50 from the 73 and add 100 to the\\n19, and the wind would be 230 ° at 119 knots with a\\ntemperature of –60 °C. If the windspeed is forecast to\\nbe 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded as 99\\nknots. For example, when the data appears as “7799,”\\nsubtract 50 from 77 and add 100 to 99, and the wind is\\n270° at 199 knots or greater. When the forecast \\nwindspeed is calm or less than 5 knots, the data group\\nis coded “9900,” which means light and variable.\\n[Figure 11-7]\\nExplanation of figure 11-7:\\nThe heading indicates that this FD was transmitted on\\nthe 15th of the month at 1640Z and is based on the 1200\\nZulu radiosonde. The valid time is 1800 Zulu on the\\nsame day and should be used for the period between\\n1700Z and 2100Z. The heading also indicates that the\\ntemperatures above 24,000 feet MSL are negative.\\nSince the temperatures above 24,000 feet are negative,\\nthe minus sign is omitted.\\nA 4-digit data group shows the wind direction in \\nreference to true north, and the windspeed in knots. The\\nelevation at Amarillo, TX (AMA) is 3,605 feet, so the\\nlowest reportable altitude is 6,000 feet for the forecast\\nwinds. In this case, “2714” means the wind is forecast\\nto be from 270°at a speed of 14 knots.\\nA 6-digit group includes the forecast temperature aloft.\\nThe elevation at Denver (DEN) is 5,431 feet, so the\\nlowest reportable altitude is 9,000 feet for the winds\\nand temperature forecast. In this case, “2321-04” \\nindicates the wind is forecast to be from 230°at a speed\\nof 21 knots with a temperature of –4°C.\\nFD KWBC 151640\\nBASED ON 151200Z DATA\\nVALID 151800Z FOR USE 1700-2100Z \\nTEMPS NEGATIVE ABV 24000\\nFD      3000     6000       9000       12000       18000       24000     30000\\nAMA                2714     2725+00  2625-04    2531-15   2542-27   265842\\nDEN                             2321-04   2532-08    2434-19   2441-31   235347\\nFigure 11-7.

They provide an overall picture of the\\nUnited States and should be used in the beginning\\nstages of flight planning. Typically, weather charts\\nshow the movement of major weather systems and\\nfronts. Surface analysis, weather depiction, and radar\\nsummary charts are sources of current weather \\ninformation. Significant weather prognostic charts \\nprovide an overall forecast weather picture.\\nSURFACE ANALYSIS CHART\\nThe surface analysis chart, depicts an analysis of the\\ncurrent surface weather. [Figure 11-8] This chart is a\\ncomputer prepared report that is transmitted every 3\\nhours and covers the contiguous 48 states and adjacent\\nareas. A surface analysis chart shows the areas of high\\nand low pressure, fronts, temperatures, dewpoints,\\nwind directions and speeds, local weather, and visual\\nobstructions.\\nSurface weather observations for reporting points\\nacross the United States are also depicted on this chart.\\nEach of these reporting points is illustrated by a station\\nmodel. [Figure 11-9] A station model will include:\\n• Type of Observation— A round model indicates\\nan official weather observer made the \\nobservation. A square model indicates the \\nobservation is from an automated station.\\nStations located offshore give data from ships,\\nbuoys, or offshore platforms.\\n• Sky Cover— The station model depicts total sky\\ncover and will be shown as clear, scattered, \\nbroken, overcast, or obscured/partially obscured.\\n• Clouds— Cloud types are represented by specific\\nsymbols. Low cloud symbols are placed beneath\\nthe station model, while middle and high cloud\\nsymbols are placed directly above the station\\nmodel. Typically, only one type of cloud will be\\ndepicted with the station model.\\n• Sea Level Pressure— Sea level pressure given in\\nthree digits to the nearest tenth of a millibar. For\\n1000 mbs or greater, prefix a 10 to the three \\ndigits. For less than 1000 mbs, prefix a 9 to the\\nthree digits.\\n• Pressure Change/Tendency— Pressure change\\nin tenths of millibars over the past 3 hours. This\\nis depicted directly below the sea level pressure.\\n• Precipitation— A record of the precipitation that\\nhas fallen over the last 6 hours to the nearest \\nhundredth of an inch.\\n• Dewpoint— Dewpoint is given in degrees\\nFahrenheit.\\nFigure 11-8.

The primary\\nconcern of this discussion is the low-level significant\\nweather prognostic chart.\\nThe low-level chart comes in two forms: the 12- and\\n24-hour forecast chart, and the 36 and 48 surface only\\nforecast chart. The first chart is a four-panel chart that\\nincludes 12- and 24-hour forecasts for significant\\nweather and surface weather. Charts are issued four\\ntimes a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The\\nvalid time for the chart is printed on the lower left-hand\\ncorner of each panel.\\nThe upper two panels show forecast significant\\nweather, which may include nonconvective turbulence,\\nfreezing levels, and IFR or MVFR weather. Areas of\\nmoderate or greater turbulence are enclosed in dashed\\nlines. Numbers within these areas give the height of the\\nturbulence in hundreds of feet MSL. Figures below the\\nline show the anticipated base, while figures above the\\nline show the top of the zone of turbulence. Also shown\\non this panel are areas of VFR, IFR, and MVFR. IFR\\nareas are enclosed by solid lines, MVFR areas are\\nenclosed by scalloped lines, and the remaining, \\nunenclosed area is designated VFR. Zigzag lines and\\nthe letters “SFC” indicate freezing levels in that area\\nare at the surface. Freezing level height contours for\\nthe highest freezing level are drawn at 4,000-foot \\nintervals with dashed lines.\\nThe lower two panels show the forecast surface\\nweather and depicts the forecast locations and \\ncharacteristics of pressure systems, fronts, and \\nprecipitation. Standard symbols are used to show fronts\\nand pressure centers. Direction of movement of the\\npressure center is depicted by an arrow. The speed, in\\nknots, is shown next to the arrow. In addition, areas of\\nforecast precipitation and thunderstorms are outlined.\\nAreas of precipitation that are shaded indicate at least\\none-half of the area is being affected by the precipita-\\ntion. Unique symbols indicate the type of precipitation\\nand the manner in which it occurs. \\nFigure 11-13 depicts a typical significant weather \\nprognostic chart as well as the symbols typically used\\nto depict precipitation. Prognostic charts are an \\nexcellent source of information for preflight planning;\\nhowever, this chart should be viewed in light of current\\nconditions and specific local area forecasts.\\nThe 36- and 48-hour significant weather prognostic\\nchart is an extension of the 12- and 24-hour forecast. It\\nprovides information regarding only surface weather\\nforecasts and includes a discussion of the forecast. This\\nchart is issued only two times a day. It typically \\ncontains forecast positions and characteristics of \\npressure patterns, fronts, and precipitation.

An airport may\\nbe a small sod field or a large complex utilized by air\\ncarriers. This chapter discusses airport operations\\nand identifies features of an airport complex, as well\\nas provides information on operating on or in the\\nvicinity of an airport.\\nTYPES OF AIRPORTS\\nThere are two types of airports.\\n• Controlled Airport\\n• Uncontrolled Airport\\nCONTROLLED AIRPORT\\nA controlled airport has an operating control tower. Air\\ntraffic control (ATC) is responsible for providing for\\nthe safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic at\\nairports where the type of operations and/or volume of\\ntraffic requires such a service. Pilots operating from a\\ncontrolled airport are required to maintain two-way\\nradio communication with air traffic controllers, and to\\nacknowledge and comply with their instructions.\\nPilots must advise ATC if they cannot comply with the\\ninstructions issued and request amended instructions.\\nA pilot may deviate from an air traffic instruction in an\\nemergency, but must advise ATC of the deviation as\\nsoon as possible.\\nUNCONTROLLED AIRPORT\\nAn uncontrolled airport does not have an operating\\ncontrol tower. Two-way radio communications are not\\nrequired, although it is a good operating practice for\\npilots to transmit their intentions on the specified fre-\\nquency for the benefit of other traffic in the area. Figure\\n12-1 lists recommended communication procedures.\\nMore information on radio communications will be\\ndiscussed later in this chapter.\\nSOURCES FOR AIRPORT DATA\\nWhen a pilot flies into a different airport, it is\\nimportant to review the current data for that airport.\\nThis data can provide the pilot with information,\\nsuch as communication frequencies, services avail-\\nable, closed runways, or airport construction. Three\\ncommon sources of information are:\\n• Aeronautical Charts\\n• Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)\\n• Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)\\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS\\nAeronautical charts provide specific information on\\nairports. Chapter 14 contains an excerpt from an aero-\\nnautical chart and an aeronautical chart legend, which\\nprovides guidance on interpreting the information on\\nthe chart.\\nAIRPORT/FACILITY DIRECTORY \\nThe Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) provides the\\nmost comprehensive information on a given airport.

It would be helpful to review an\\nA/FD to become familiar with the information it\\ncontains.\\nNOTICES TO AIRMEN\\nNotices to Airmen (NOTAMs) provide the most current\\ninformation available. They provide time-critical infor-\\nmation on airports and changes that affect the national\\nairspace system and are of concern to instrument flight\\nrule (IFR) operations. NOTAM information is classified\\ninto three categories. These are NOTAM-D or distant,\\nNOTAM-L or local, and flight data center (FDC)\\nNOTAMs. NOTAM-Ds are attached to hourly weather\\nreports and are available at flight service stations\\n(AFSS/FSS). NOTAM-Ls include items of a local nature,\\nsuch as taxiway closures or construction near a runway.\\nThese NOTAMs are maintained at the FSS nearest the\\nairport affected. NOTAM-Ls must be requested from an\\nFSS other than the one nearest the local airport for which\\nthe NOTAM was issued. FDC NOTAMs are issued by\\nthe National Flight Data Center and contain regulatory\\ninformation, such as temporary flight restrictions or an\\namendment to instrument approach procedures. The\\nNOTAM-Ds and FDC NOTAMs are contained in the\\nNotices to Airmen publication, which is issued every 28\\ndays. Prior to any flight, pilots should check for any\\nNOTAMs that could affect their intended flight.\\nAIRPORT MARKINGS AND SIGNS\\nThere are markings and signs used at airports, which\\nprovide directions and assist pilots in airport opera-\\ntions. Some of the most common markings and signs\\nwill be discussed. Additional information may be found\\nin the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).\\nRUNWAY MARKINGS\\nRunway markings vary depending on the type of oper-\\nations conducted at the airport. Figure 12-3 shows a\\nrunway that is approved as a precision instrument\\napproach runway and also shows some other common\\nrunway markings. A basic VFR runway may only have\\ncenterline markings and runway numbers.\\nSince aircraft are affected by the wind during takeoffs\\nand landings, runways are laid out according to the\\nlocal prevailing winds. Runway numbers are in refer-\\nence to magnetic north. Certain airports have two or\\neven three runways laid out in the same direction.\\nThese are referred to as parallel runways and are distin-\\nguished by a letter being added to the runway number.\\nExamples are runway 36L (left), 36C (center), and 36R\\n(right).\\nAnother feature of some runways is a displaced thresh-\\nold. A threshold may be displaced because of an\\nobstruction near the end of the runway. Although this\\nportion of the runway is not to be used for landing, it\\nmay be available for taxiing, takeoff, or landing rollout.\\nSome airports may have a blast pad/stopway area. The\\nblast pad is an area where a propeller or jet blast can\\ndissipate without creating a hazard. The stopway area\\nis paved in order to provide space for an airplane to\\ndecelerate and stop in the event of an aborted takeoff.\\nThese areas cannot be used for takeoff or landing.\\nTAXIWAY MARKINGS\\nAirplanes use taxiways to transition from parking\\nareas to the runway. Taxiways are identified by a con-\\ntinuous yellow centerline stripe. A taxiway may\\ninclude edge markings to define the edge of the taxi-\\nway. This is usually done when the taxiway edge does\\nnot correspond with the edge of the pavement. If an\\nedge marking is a continuous line, the paved shoulder\\nis not intended to be used by an airplane. If it is a\\ndashed marking, an airplane may use that portion of\\nthe pavement. Where a taxiway approaches a runway,\\nthere may be a holding position marker. These consist\\nof four yellow lines (two solid and two dashed). The\\nsolid lines are where the airplane is to hold. At some\\ncontrolled airports, holding position markings may be\\nfound on a runway. They are used when there are\\nintersecting runways, and air traffic control issues\\ninstructions such as “cleared to land—hold short of\\nrunway 30.”\\nOTHER MARKINGS\\nSome of the other markings found on the airport\\ninclude vehicle roadway markings, VOR receiver\\ncheckpoint markings, and non-movement area bound-\\nary markings.\\nVehicle roadway markings are used when necessary to\\ndefine a pathway for vehicle crossing areas that are also\\nintended for aircraft. These markings usually consist of\\na solid white line to delineate each edge of the roadway\\nand a dashed line to separate lanes within the edges of\\nthe roadway.\\nA VOR receiver checkpoint marking consists of a\\npainted circle with an arrow in the middle. The arrow is\\naligned in the direction of the checkpoint azimuth. This\\nallows pilots to check aircraft instruments with naviga-\\ntional aid signals.\\nA non-movement area boundary marking delineates a\\nmovement area under air traffic control. These mark-\\nings are yellow and located on the boundary between\\nthe movement and non-movement area. They normally\\nconsist of two yellow lines (one solid and one dashed).\\nAIRPORT SIGNS\\nThere are six types of signs that may be found at air-\\nports.

The variety and type of lighting\\nsystems depends on the volume and complexity of\\noperations at a given airport. Airport lighting is stan-\\ndardized so that airports use the same light colors for\\nrunways and taxiways.\\nAIRPORT BEACON\\nAirport beacons help a pilot identify an airport at night.\\nThe beacons are operated from dusk till dawn and\\nsometimes they are turned on if the ceiling is less than\\n1,000 feet and/or the ground visibility is less than 3\\nstatute miles (visual flight rules minimums). However,\\nthere is no requirement for this, so a pilot has the\\nresponsibility of determining if the weather is VFR.\\nThe beacon has a vertical light distribution to make it\\nmost effective from 1-10° above the horizon, although\\nit can be seen well above or below this spread. The bea-\\ncon may be an omnidirectional capacitor-discharge\\ndevice, or it may rotate at a constant speed, which pro-\\nduces the visual effect of flashes at regular intervals.\\nThe combination of light colors from an airport beacon\\nindicates the type of airport. [Figure 12-5]\\nSome of the most common beacons are:\\n• Flashing white and green for civilian land\\nairports.\\n• Flashing white and yellow for a water airport.\\n• Flashing white, yellow, and green for a heliport.\\n• Two quick white flashes followed by a green\\nflash identifies a military airport.\\n4-22\\n8-APCH\\nILS\\n4\\nB\\n22\\nJ\\nL\\n22\\nMIL\\n Hold short of runway on taxiway\\nExit boundary of ILS critical area\\nDefines directions to takeoff runways\\nDefines directions for arriving aircraft\\nProvides remaining runway length\\nin 1,000 feet increments\\nIndicates taxiway does not continue\\nDefines direction & designation of exit taxiway\\nfrom runway\\nRunway Exit:.\\nDefines direction & designation of intersecting\\ntaxiway(s)\\nTaxiway Direction:\\nHold short of aircraft on approach\\nHold short of ILS approach critical area\\nIdentifies paved areas where aircraft entry is\\nprohibited\\nIdentifies taxiway on which aircraft is located\\nIdentifies runway on which aircraft is located\\nTaxiway/Runway Hold Position:\\nRunway  Approach Hold Position:\\nILS Critical Area Hold Position:\\nExit boundary of runway protected areas\\nRunway Safety Area/Obstacle Free\\nZone Boundary:\\nILS Critical Area Boundary:\\nNo Entry:\\nTaxiway Location:\\nOutbound Destination:\\nInbound Destination:\\nTaxiway Ending MarkerRunway Location:\\nRunway Distance Remaining\\nTYPE OF SIGN AND ACTION OR PURPOSETYPE OF SIGN AND ACTION OR PURPOSE\\nAIRPORT SIGN SYSTEMS\\n26-8\\nRunway/Runway Hold Position:\\n Hold short of intersecting runway\\nA      LG\\nDirection Sign Array:\\nIdentifies location in conjunction with\\nmultiple intersecting taxiways\\nFigure 12-4.

The system configura-\\ntion depends on whether the runway is a precision or\\nnonprecision instrument runway. Some systems\\ninclude sequenced flashing lights, which appear to\\nthe pilot as a ball of light traveling toward the run-\\nway at high speed. Approach lights can also aid\\npilots operating under VFR at night.\\nVISUAL GLIDESLOPE INDICATORS\\nVisual glideslope indicators provide the pilot with\\nglidepath information that can be used for day or night\\napproaches. By maintaining the proper glidepath as\\nprovided by the system, a pilot should have adequate\\nobstacle clearance and should touch down within a\\nspecified portion of the runway.\\nVISUAL APPROACH SLOPE INDICATOR\\nVisual approach slope indicator (VASI) installations\\nare the most common visual glidepath systems in use.\\nThe VASI provides obstruction clearance within 10°\\nof the runway extended runway centerline, and to 4\\nnautical miles (NM) from the runway threshold.\\nA V ASI consists of light units arranged in bars. There\\nare 2-bar and 3-bar VASIs. The 2-bar VASI has near\\nand far light bars and the 3-bar V ASI has near, middle,\\nand far light bars. Two-bar V ASI installations provide\\none visual glidepath which is normally set at 3°. The\\n3-bar system provides two glidepaths with the lower\\nglidepath normally set at 3° and the upper glidepath\\none-fourth degree above the lower glidepath.\\nThe basic principle of the V ASI is that of color differen-\\ntiation between red and white. Each light unit projects a\\nbeam of light having a white segment in the upper part\\nof the beam and a red segment in the lower part of the\\nbeam. The lights are arranged so the pilot will see the\\ncombination of lights shown in figure 12-6 to indicate\\nbelow, on, or above the glidepath.\\nOTHER GLIDEPATH SYSTEMS\\nA precision approach path indicator (PAPI) uses lights\\nsimilar to the V ASI system except they are installed in\\na single row, normally on the left side of the runway.\\n[Figure 12-7]\\nA tri-color system consists of a single light unit pro-\\njecting a three-color visual approach path. A below the\\nglidepath indication is red, on the glidepath color is\\ngreen, and above the glidepath is indicated by amber.\\nWhen descending below the glidepath, there is a small\\narea of dark amber. Pilots should not mistake this area\\nfor an “above the glidepath” indication. [Figure 12-8]\\nThere are also pulsating systems, which consist of a\\nsingle light unit projecting a two-color visual approach\\npath. A below the glidepath indication is shown by a\\nsteady red light, slightly below is indicated by pulsat-\\ning red, on the glidepath is indicated by a steady white\\nlight, and a pulsating white light indicates above the\\nglidepath. [Figure 12-9]\\nRUNWAY LIGHTING\\nThere are various lights that identify parts of the runway\\ncomplex. These assist a pilot in safely making a takeoff\\nor landing during night operations.\\nRUNWAY END IDENTIFIER LIGHTS\\nRunway end identifier lights (REIL) are installed at\\nmany airfields to provide rapid and positive identifi-\\nHigh\\n(More Than\\n3.5 Degrees)\\nSlightly High\\n(3.2 Degrees)\\nOn Glidepath\\n(3 Degrees)\\nSlightly Low\\n(2.8 Degrees)\\nLow\\n(Less Than\\n2.5 Degrees)\\nBelow Glidepath\\nNear Bar\\nFar Bar\\nOn Glidepath Above Glidepath\\nFigure 12-6. 2-Bar VASI system.\\nFigure 12-7.

The\\nsystem consists of a pair of synchronized flashing\\nlights located laterally on each side of the runway\\nthreshold. REILs may be either omnidirectional or\\nunidirectional facing the approach area.\\nRUNWAY EDGE LIGHTS\\nRunway edge lights are used to outline the edges of\\nrunways at night or during low visibility conditions.\\nThese lights are classified according to the intensity\\nthey are capable of producing. They are classified as\\nhigh intensity runway lights (HIRL), medium intensity\\nrunway lights (MIRL), or low intensity runway lights\\n(LIRL). The HIRL and MIRL have variable intensity\\nsettings. These lights are white, except on instrument\\nrunways, where amber lights are used on the last 2,000\\nfeet or half the length of the runway, whichever is less.\\nThe lights marking the end of the runway are red.\\nIN-RUNWAY LIGHTING\\nTouchdown zone lights (TDZL), runway centerline\\nlights (RCLS), and taxiway turnoff lights are installed\\non some precision runways to facilitate landing under\\nadverse visibility conditions. TDZLs are two rows of\\ntransverse light bars disposed symmetrically about the\\nrunway centerline in the runway touchdown zone.\\nRCLS consists of flush centerline lights spaced at 50\\nfoot intervals beginning 75 feet from the landing\\nthreshold. Taxiway turnoff lights are flush lights, which\\nemit a steady green color.\\nCONTROL OF AIRPORT LIGHTING\\nAirport lighting is controlled by air traffic controllers\\nat controlled airports. At uncontrolled airports, the\\nlights may be on a timer, or where an FSS is located at\\nan airport, the FSS personnel may control the light-\\ning. A pilot may request various light systems be\\nturned on or off and also request a specified intensity,\\nif available, from ATC or FSS personnel. At selected\\nuncontrolled airports, the pilot may control the light-\\ning by using the radio. This is done by selecting a\\nspecified frequency and clicking the radio micro-\\nphone.

At many airports, these\\nedge lights may have variable intensity settings that\\nmay be adjusted by an air traffic controller when\\ndeemed necessary or when requested by the pilot.\\nSome airports also have taxiway centerline lights that\\nare green in color.\\nOBSTRUCTION LIGHTS\\nObstructions are marked or lighted to warn pilots of\\ntheir presence during daytime and nighttime condi-\\ntions. Obstruction lighting can be found both on and\\noff an airport to identify obstructions. They may be\\nmarked or lighted in any of the following conditions.\\n• Red Obstruction Lights—either flash or emit a\\nsteady red color during nighttime operations, and\\nthe obstructions are painted orange and white for\\ndaytime operations.\\n• High Intensity White Obstruction Light —\\nflashes high intensity white lights during the\\ndaytime with the intensity reduced for nighttime.\\n• Dual Lighting—is a combination of flashing red\\nbeacons and steady red lights for nighttime oper-\\nation, and high intensity white lights for daytime\\noperations.\\nWIND DIRECTION INDICATORS\\nIt is important for a pilot to know the direction of the\\nwind. At facilities with an operating control tower,\\nthis information is provided by ATC. Information\\nmay also be provided by FSS personnel located at a\\nparticular airport or by requesting information on a\\ncommon traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) at air-\\nports that have the capacity to receive and broadcast\\non this frequency.\\nWhen none of these services is available, it is possible\\nto determine wind direction and runway in use by\\nvisual wind indicators. A pilot should check these wind\\nindicators even when information is provided on the\\nCTAF at a given airport because there is no assurance\\nthat the information provided is accurate.\\nWind direction indicators include a wind sock, wind\\ntee, or tetrahedron. These are usually located in a cen-\\ntral location near the runway and may be placed in the\\ncenter of a segmented circle, which will identify the\\ntraffic pattern direction, if it is other than the standard\\nleft-hand pattern. [Figures 12-11 and 12-12]\\nThe wind sock is a good source of information since it\\nnot only indicates wind direction, but allows the pilot\\nto estimate the wind velocity and gusts or factor. The\\nwind sock extends out straighter in strong winds and\\nwill tend to move back and forth when the wind is\\ngusty. Wind tees and tetrahedrons can swing freely, and\\nwill align themselves with the wind direction. The wind\\ntee and tetrahedron can also be manually set to align\\nwith the runway in use; therefore, a pilot should also\\nlook at the wind sock, if available.\\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\\nOperating in and out of a controlled airport, as well\\nas in a good portion of the airspace system, requires\\nthat an aircraft have two-way radio communication\\ncapability. For this reason, a pilot should be knowl-\\nedgeable of radio station license requirements and\\nradio communications equipment and procedures.\\nRADIO LICENSE\\nThere is no license requirement for a pilot operating\\nin the United States; however, a pilot who operates\\ninternationally is required to hold a restricted\\nradiotelephone permit issued by the Federal\\nCommunications Commission (FCC). There is also\\nno station license requirement for most general avia-\\ntion aircraft operating in the United States. A station\\nlicense is required however for an aircraft which is\\noperating internationally, which uses other than a very\\nhigh frequency (VHF) radio, and which meets other\\ncriteria.\\nRADIO EQUIPMENT\\nIn general aviation, the most common types of radios\\nare VHF. A VHF radio operates on frequencies\\nbetween 118.0 and 136.975 and is classified as 720 or\\n760 depending on the number of channels it can\\naccommodate. The 720 and 760 uses .025 spacing\\n(118.025, 118.050) with the 720 having a frequency\\nrange up to 135.975 and the 760 going up to 136.975.\\nVHF radios are limited to line of sight transmissions;\\n7 times within 5\\nseconds\\n5 times within 5\\nseconds\\n3 times within 5\\nseconds\\nHighest intensity available\\nMedium or lower intensity\\n(Lower REIL or REIL off)\\nLowest intensity available\\n(Lower REIL or REIL off)\\nKEY MIKE FUNCTION\\nFigure 12-10.

The lowest pressure occurs over\\nthe upper wing surface, and the highest pressure under\\nthe wing. This pressure differential triggers the rollup of\\nthe airflow aft of the wing resulting in swirling air\\nmasses trailing downstream of the wingtips. After the\\nrollup is completed, the wake consists of two counter-\\nrotating cylindrical vortices. Most of the energy is within\\na few feet of the center of each vortex, but pilots should\\navoid a region within about 100 feet of the vortex core.\\n[Figure 12-17]\\nVORTEX STRENGTH\\nThe strength of the vortex is governed by the weight,\\nspeed, and shape of the wing of the generating aircraft.\\nThe vortex characteristics of any given aircraft can also\\nbe changed by the extension of flaps or other wing con-\\nfiguration devices as well as by a change in speed. The\\ngreatest vortex strength occurs when the generating air-\\ncraft is heavy, clean, and slow.\\nVORTEX BEHAVIOR\\nTrailing vortices have certain behavioral characteristics\\nthat can help a pilot visualize the wake location and take\\navoidance precautions.\\nVortices are generated from the moment an aircraft\\nleaves the ground, since trailing vortices are the by-\\nproduct of wing lift. The vortex circulation is outward,\\nupward, and around the wingtips when viewed from\\neither ahead or behind the aircraft. Tests have shown\\nthat vortices remain spaced a bit less than a wingspan\\napart, drifting with the wind, at altitudes greater than a\\nwingspan from the ground. Tests have also shown that\\nthe vortices sink at a rate of several hundred feet per\\nminute, slowing their descent and diminishing in\\nstrength with time and distance behind the generating\\naircraft. [Figure 12-18]\\nWhen the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the\\nground (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move lat-\\nerally over the ground at a speed of 2 or 3 knots. A\\ncrosswind will decrease the lateral movement of the\\nupwind vortex and increase the movement of the down-\\nwind vortex. A tailwind condition can move the vortices\\nof the preceding aircraft forward into the touchdown\\nzone.\\nVORTEX AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on the same\\nrunway—stay at or above the larger aircraft’s\\napproach flightpath and land beyond its touch-\\ndown point.\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on a parallel\\nrunway closer than 2,500 feet—consider the\\npossibility of drift and stay at or above the larger\\naircraft’s final approach flightpath and note its\\ntouchdown point.\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on crossing run-\\nway—cross above the larger aircraft’s flightpath.\\nFigure 12-17.

The pilot can contribute to collision avoid-\\nance by being alert and scanning for other aircraft. This\\nis particularly important in the vicinity of an airport.\\nEffective scanning is accomplished with a series of\\nshort, regularly spaced eye movements that bring suc-\\ncessive areas of the sky into the central visual field.\\nEach movement should not exceed 10°, and each\\nshould be observed for at least 1 second to enable\\ndetection. Although back and forth eye movements\\nseem preferred by most pilots, each pilot should\\ndevelop a scanning pattern that is most comfortable and\\nthen adhere to it to assure optimum scanning.\\nEven if entitled to the right-of-way, a pilot should give\\nway if it is felt another aircraft is too close.\\nCLEARING PROCEDURES\\nThe following procedures and considerations\\nshould assist a pilot in collision avoidance under\\nvarious situations.\\n• Before Takeoff—Prior to taxiing onto a runway\\nor landing area in preparation for takeoff, pilots\\nshould scan the approach area for possible land-\\ning traffic, executing appropriate maneuvers to\\nprovide a clear view of the approach areas.\\n• Climbs and Descents —During climbs and\\ndescents in flight conditions which permit visual\\ndetection of other traffic, pilots should execute\\ngentle banks left and right at a frequency which\\npermits continuous visual scanning of the air-\\nspace.\\n• Straight and Level —During sustained peri-\\nods of straight-and-level flight, a pilot should\\nexecute appropriate clearing procedures at\\nperiodic intervals.\\n• Traffic Patterns —Entries into traffic patterns\\nwhile descending should be avoided.\\n• Traffic at VOR Sites—Due to converging traffic,\\nsustained vigilance should be maintained in the\\nvicinity of VORs and intersections.\\n• Training Operations —Vigilance should be\\nmaintained and clearing turns should be made\\nprior to a practice maneuver. During instruction,\\nthe pilot should be asked to verbalize the clearing\\nprocedures (call out “clear left, right, above, and\\nbelow”).\\nHigh-wing and low-wing aircraft have their respective\\nblind spots. High-wing aircraft should momentarily\\nraise their wing in the direction of the intended turn and\\nlook for traffic prior to commencing the turn. Low-\\nwing aircraft should momentarily lower the wing.\\nRUNWAY INCURSION AVOIDANCE\\nIt is important to give the same attention to operat-\\ning on the surface as in other phases of flights.\\nProper planning can prevent runway incursions and\\nthe possibility of a ground collision. A pilot should\\nbe aware of the airplane’s position on the surface at\\nall times and be aware of other aircraft and vehicle\\noperations on the airport. At times controlled air-\\nports can be busy and taxi instructions complex. In\\nCh 12.qxd  10/24/03  8:24 AM  Page 12-14'),\n",

The activities may be much the same as\\nthose for a restricted area. Warning areas are estab-\\nlished beyond the 3-mile limit. Warning areas are\\ndepicted on aeronautical charts.\\nMILITARY OPERATION AREAS\\nMilitary operation areas (MOA) consist of airspace\\nof defined vertical and lateral limits established for\\nthe purpose of separating certain military training\\nactivity from IFR traffic. There is no restriction\\nagainst a pilot operating VFR in these areas; how-\\never, a pilot should be alert since training activities\\nmay include acrobatic and abrupt maneuvers. MOAs\\nare depicted on aeronautical charts.\\nALERT AREAS\\nAlert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts and are\\nto advise pilots that a high volume of pilot training or\\nunusual aerial activity is taking place.\\nCONTROLLED FIRING AREAS\\nControlled firing areas contain activities, which, if\\nnot conducted in a controlled environment, could be\\nhazardous to nonparticipating aircraft. The difference\\nbetween controlled firing areas and other special use\\nairspace is that activities must be suspended when a\\nspotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position\\nindicates an aircraft might be approaching the area.\\nOTHER AIRSPACE AREAS\\n“Other airspace areas” is a general term referring to\\nthe majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:\\n• Airport Advisory Areas\\n• Military Training Routes (MTR)\\n• Temporary Flight Restrictions\\n• Parachute Jump Areas\\n• Published VFR Routes\\n•        Terminal Radar Service Areas\\n• National Security Areas\\nAIRPORT ADVISORY AREAS\\nAn airport advisory area is an area within 10 statute\\nmiles (SM) of an airport where a control tower is not\\noperating, but where a flight service station (FSS) is\\nlocated. At these locations, the FSS provides advi-\\nsory service to arriving and departing aircraft.\\nMILITARY TRAINING ROUTES\\nMilitary training routes (MTR) are developed to\\nallow the military to conduct low-altitude, high-\\nspeed training. The routes above 1,500 feet AGL\\nare developed to be flown primarily under IFR, and\\nthe routes 1,500 feet and less are for VFR flight.\\nThe routes are identified on sectional charts by the\\ndesignation “instrument (IR) or visual (VR).”\\nTEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS\\nAn FDC NOTAM will be issued to designate a tem-\\nporary flight restriction (TFR). The NOTAM will\\nbegin with the phrase “FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS”\\nfollowed by the location of the temporary restriction,\\neffective time period, area defined in statute miles,\\nand altitudes affected. The NOTAM will also contain\\nthe FAA coordination facility and telephone number,\\nthe reason for the restriction, and any other informa-\\ntion deemed appropriate. The pilot should check the\\nNOTAMs as part of flight planning.\\nSome of the purposes for establishing a temporary\\nrestriction are:\\n• Protect persons and property in the air or on the \\nsurface from an existing or imminent hazard.\\n• Provide a safe environment for the operation of \\ndisaster relief aircraft.\\n• Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing\\naircraft above an incident or event, which may\\ngenerate a high degree of public interest.\\n• Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian \\nreasons in the State of Hawaii.\\n• Protect the President, Vice President, or other \\npublic figures.\\n• Provide a safe environment for space agency \\noperations.\\nPARACHUTE JUMP AREAS\\nParachute jump areas are published in the\\nAirport/Facility Directory . Sites that are used fre-\\nquently are depicted on sectional charts.\\nPUBLISHED VFR ROUTES\\nPublished VFR routes are for transitioning around,\\nunder, or through some complex airspace. Terms\\nsuch as VFR flyway, VFR corridor, Class B airspace,\\nVFR transition route, and terminal area VFR route\\nhave been applied to such routes. These routes are\\ngenerally found on VFR terminal area planning\\ncharts.\\nCh 13.qxd  10/24/03  8:40 AM  Page 13-4'),\n",

The chart provides information which\\nallows pilots to track their position and provides avail-\\nable information which enhances safety.

The charts have a scale of 1:500,000\\n(1 inch = 6.86 nautical miles or approximately 8\\nstatute miles) which allows for more detailed infor-\\nmation to be included on the chart.\\nThe charts provide an abundance of information,\\nincluding airport data, navigational aids, airspace,\\nand topography. Figure 14-1 on the next page is an\\nexcerpt from the legend of a sectional chart. By\\nreferring to the chart legend, a pilot can interpret\\nmost of the information on the chart. A pilot should\\nalso check the chart for other legend information,\\nwhich includes air traffic control frequencies and\\ninformation on airspace.

They are pro-\\nduced at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (1 inch = 13.7 nautical\\nmiles or approximately 16 statute miles). These charts\\nare similar to sectional charts and the symbols are the\\nsame except there is less detail due to the smaller scale.\\nThese charts are revised annually except several\\nAlaskan charts and the Mexican/Caribbean charts\\nwhich are revised every 2 years.\\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE\\n(MERIDIANS AND PARALLELS)\\nThe Equator is an imaginary circle equidistant from the\\npoles of the Earth. Circles parallel to the Equator (lines\\nrunning east and west) are parallels of latitude. They\\nare used to measure degrees of latitude north or south\\nof the Equator. The angular distance from the Equator\\nto the pole is one-fourth of a circle or 90°. The 48 con-\\nterminous states of the United States are located\\nbetween 25° and 49° N. latitude. The arrows in figure\\n14-2 labeled “LATITUDE” point to lines of latitude.\\nMeridians of longitude are drawn from the North Pole\\nto the South Pole and are at right angles to the Equator.\\nThe “Prime Meridian” which passes through\\nGreenwich, England, is used as the zero line from\\nwhich measurements are made in degrees east and west\\nto 180°. The 48 conterminous states of the United\\nStates are between 67° and 125° W. Longitude. The\\narrows in figure 14-2 labeled “LONGITUDE” point to\\nlines of longitude.\\nAny specific geographical point can thus be located by\\nreference to its longitude and latitude. Washington, DC\\nfor example, is approximately 39° N. latitude, 77° W.\\nlongitude. Chicago is approximately 42° N. latitude,\\n88° W. longitude.\\nTIME ZONES\\nThe meridians are also useful for designating time\\nzones. A day is defined as the time required for the\\nEarth to make one complete rotation of 360°. Since the\\nday is divided into 24 hours, the Earth revolves at the\\nrate of 15° an hour. Noon is the time when the Sun is\\ndirectly above a meridian; to the west of that meridian\\nis morning, to the east is afternoon.\\nThe standard practice is to establish a time zone for\\neach 15° of longitude. This makes a difference of\\nexactly 1 hour between each zone. In the United States,\\nthere are four time zones. The time zones are Eastern\\n(75°), Central (90°), Mountain (105°), and Pacific\\n(120°). The dividing lines are somewhat irregular\\nFigure 14-1.

Air traffic control instructions,\\nweather reports and broadcasts, and estimated times of\\narrival are all based on this system.

It is\\ncalled Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and is often\\nreferred to as Zulu time. UTC is the time at the 0° line\\nof longitude which passes through Greenwich,\\nEngland. All of the time zones around the world are\\nbased on this reference. To convert to this time, a pilot\\nshould do the following:\\nEastern Standard Time..........Add 5 hours\\nCentral Standard Time..........Add 6 hours\\nMountain Standard Time...... Add 7 hours\\nPacific Standard Time.......... Add 8 hours\\nFor daylight saving time, 1 hour should be subtracted\\nfrom the calculated times.\\nMEASUREMENT OF DIRECTION\\nBy using the meridians, direction from one point to\\nanother can be measured in degrees, in a clockwise\\ndirection from true north. To indicate a course to be fol-\\nlowed in flight, draw a line on the chart from the point\\nof departure to the destination and measure the angle\\nwhich this line forms with a meridian. Direction is\\nexpressed in degrees, as shown by the compass rose in\\nfigure 14-4.\\nBecause meridians converge toward the poles, course\\nmeasurement should be taken at a meridian near the\\nmidpoint of the course rather than at the point of depar-\\nture. The course measured on the chart is known as the\\ntrue course. This is the direction measured by reference\\nto a meridian or true north. It is the direction of\\nintended flight as measured in degrees clockwise from\\ntrue north. \\n11:00 AM 12: NOON 1:00 PM10:00 AM\\n120°\\n105°\\n90°\\n75°Pacific Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nMountain Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nCentral Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nEastern Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nFigure 14-3.

Usually, it is neces-\\nsary to head the airplane in a direction slightly different\\nfrom the true course to offset the effect of wind.\\nConsequently, numerical value of the true heading may\\nnot correspond with that of the true course. This will be\\ndiscussed more fully in subsequent sections in this\\nchapter. For the purpose of this discussion, assume a\\nno-wind condition exists under which heading and\\ncourse would coincide. Thus, for a true course of 065°,\\nthe true heading would be 065°. To use the compass\\naccurately, however, corrections must be made for\\nmagnetic variation and compass deviation.\\nVARIATION\\nVariation is the angle between true north and magnetic\\nnorth. It is expressed as east variation or west variation\\ndepending upon whether magnetic north (MN) is to the\\neast or west of true north (TN).\\nThe north magnetic pole is located close to 71° N. lati-\\ntude, 96° W. longitude and is about 1,300 miles from\\nthe geographic or true north pole, as indicated in figure\\n14-6. If the Earth were uniformly magnetized, the com-\\npass needle would point toward the magnetic pole, in\\nwhich case the variation between true north (as shown\\nby the geographical meridians) and magnetic north (as\\nshown by the magnetic meridians) could be measured\\nat any intersection of the meridians.\\nActually, the Earth is not uniformly magnetized. In the\\nUnited States, the needle usually points in the general\\ndirection of the magnetic pole, but it may vary in certain\\ngeographical localities by many degrees. Consequently,\\nthe exact amount of variation at thousands of selected\\nlocations in the United States has been carefully deter-\\nmined. The amount and the direction of variation, which\\nchange slightly from time to time, are shown on most\\naeronautical charts as broken magenta lines, called iso-\\ngonic lines, which connect points of equal magnetic\\nvariation. (The line connecting points at which there is\\nno variation between true north and magnetic north is\\nthe agonic line.) An isogonic chart is shown in figure\\n14-6. Minor bends and turns in the isogonic and agonic\\nlines are caused by unusual geological conditions\\naffecting magnetic forces in these areas.\\nOn the west coast of the United States, the compass\\nneedle points to the east of true north; on the east coast,\\nthe compass needle points to the west of true north.\\nZero degree variation exists on the agonic line, where\\nmagnetic north and true north coincide. This line runs\\nroughly west of the Great Lakes, south through\\nWisconsin, Illinois, western Tennessee, and along the\\nborder of Mississippi and Alabama. [Compare figures\\n14-7 and 14-8.]\\nBecause courses are measured in reference to geograph-\\nical meridians which point toward true north, and these\\ncourses are maintained by reference to the compass\\nwhich points along a magnetic meridian in the general\\ndirection of magnetic north, the true direction must be\\nconverted into magnetic direction for the purpose of\\nflight. This conversion is made by adding or subtracting\\nthe variation which is indicated by the nearest isogonic\\nline on the chart.

To determine compass heading, a correc-\\ntion for deviation must be made. Because of magnetic\\ninfluences within the airplane such as electrical cir-\\ncuits, radio, lights, tools, engine, and magnetized metal\\nparts, the compass needle is frequently deflected from\\nits normal reading. This deflection is deviation. The\\ndeviation is different for each airplane, and it also may\\nvary for different headings in the same airplane. For\\ninstance, if magnetism in the engine attracts the north\\nend of the compass, there would be no effect when the\\nplane is on a heading of magnetic north. On easterly or\\nwesterly headings, however, the compass indications\\nwould be in error, as shown in figure 14-9. Magnetic\\nattraction can come from many other parts of the air-\\nplane; the assumption of attraction in the engine is\\nmerely used for the purpose of illustration.\\nSome adjustment of the compass, referred to as com-\\npensation, can be made to reduce this error, but the\\nremaining correction must be applied by the pilot.\\nProper compensation of the compass is best performed\\nby a competent technician. Since the magnetic forces\\nwithin the airplane change, because of landing shocks,\\nvibration, mechanical work, or changes in equipment,\\nthe pilot should occasionally have the deviation of the\\ncompass checked. The procedure used to check the\\ndeviation (called “swinging the compass”) is briefly\\noutlined.\\nThe airplane is placed on a magnetic compass rose, the\\nengine started, and electrical devices normally used\\n(such as radio) are turned on.

[Figure 14-11]\\nEFFECT OF WIND\\nThe preceding discussion explained how to measure a\\ntrue course on the aeronautical chart and how to make\\ncorrections for variation and deviation, but one\\nimportant factor has not been considered—wind. As\\ndiscussed in the study of the atmosphere, wind is a\\nmass of air moving over the surface of the Earth in a\\ndefinite direction. When the wind is blowing from the\\nnorth at 25 knots, it simply means that air is moving\\nsouthward over the Earth’s surface at the rate of 25\\nnautical miles (NM) in 1 hour.\\nUnder these conditions, any inert object free from con-\\ntact with the Earth will be carried 25 NM southward in\\n1 hour. This effect becomes apparent when such things\\nas clouds, dust, and toy balloons are observed being\\nblown along by the wind. Obviously, an airplane flying\\nwithin the moving mass of air will be similarly\\naffected. Even though the airplane does not float freely\\nwith the wind, it moves through the air at the same time\\nthe air is moving over the ground, thus is affected by\\nwind. Consequently, at the end of 1 hour of flight, the\\nairplane will be in a position which results from a com-\\nbination of these two motions:\\n• the movement of the air mass in reference to the\\nground, and\\n• the forward movement of the airplane through the\\nair mass.\\nActually, these two motions are independent. So far as\\nthe airplane’s flight through the air is concerned, it\\nmakes no difference whether the mass of air through\\nwhich the airplane is flying is moving or is stationary.\\nA pilot flying in a 70-knot gale would be totally\\nunaware of any wind (except for possible turbulence)\\nunless the ground were observed. In reference to the\\nground, however, the airplane would appear to fly\\nfaster with a tailwind or slower with a headwind, or to\\ndrift right or left with a crosswind.\\nAs shown in figure 14-12, an airplane flying eastward\\nat an airspeed of 120 knots in still air, will have a\\ngroundspeed exactly the same—120 knots. If the mass\\nof air is moving eastward at 20 knots, the airspeed of\\nthe airplane will not be affected, but the progress of the\\nairplane over the ground will be 120 plus 20, or a\\ngroundspeed of 140 knots. On the other hand, if the\\nmass of air is moving westward at 20 knots, the air-\\nspeed of the airplane still remains the same, but\\ngroundspeed becomes 120 minus 20 or 100 knots.\\nFigure 14-10.

It will be 20 miles south because of the motion of\\nthe air. Under these circumstances, the airspeed\\nremains 120 knots, but the groundspeed is determined\\nby combining the movement of the airplane with that\\nof the air mass. Groundspeed can be measured as the\\ndistance from the point of departure to the position of\\nthe airplane at the end of 1 hour. The groundspeed can\\nbe computed by the time required to fly between two\\npoints a known distance apart. It also can be deter-\\nmined before flight by constructing a wind triangle,\\nwhich will be explained later in this chapter. [Figure\\n14-13]\\nThe direction in which the plane is pointing as it flies is\\nheading. Its actual path over the ground, which is a\\ncombination of the motion of the airplane and the\\nmotion of the air, is track. The angle between the head-\\ning and the track is drift angle. If the airplane’s heading\\ncoincides with the true course and the wind is blowing\\nfrom the left, the track will not coincide with the true\\ncourse. The wind will drift the airplane to the right, so\\nthe track will fall to the right of the desired course or\\ntrue course. [Figure 14-14]\\nBy determining the amount of drift, the pilot can\\ncounteract the effect of the wind and make the track\\nof the airplane coincide with the desired course. If the\\nmass of air is moving across the course from the left,\\nthe airplane will drift to the right, and a correction\\nmust be made by heading the airplane sufficiently to\\nthe left to offset this drift. To state in another way, if\\nthe wind is from the left, the correction will be made\\nby pointing the airplane to the left a certain number of\\ndegrees, therefore correcting for wind drift. This is\\nwind correction angle and is expressed in terms of\\ndegrees right or left of the true course.

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60\\n(60 minutes = 1 hour). Thus, 30 minutes 30/60 = 0.5\\nhour. To convert hours to minutes, multiply by 60.\\nThus, 0.75 hour equals 0.75 x 60 = 45 minutes.\\nTime T = D/GS\\nTo find the time (T) in flight, divide the distance (D)\\nby the groundspeed (GS). The time to fly 210 nautical\\nmiles at a groundspeed of 140 knots is 210 divided by\\n140, or 1.5 hours. (The 0.5 hour multiplied by 60 min-\\nutes equals 30 minutes.) Answer: 1:30.\\nDistance D = GS X T\\nTo find the distance flown in a given time, multiply\\ngroundspeed by time. The distance flown in 1 hour 45\\nminutes at a groundspeed of 120 knots is 120 x 1.75, or\\n210 nautical miles.\\nGroundspeed GS = D/T\\nTo find the groundspeed, divide the distance flown by\\nthe time required. If an airplane flies 270 nautical miles\\nin 3 hours, the groundspeed is 270 divided by 3 = 90\\nknots.\\nCONVERTING KNOTS TO MILES PER HOUR\\nAnother conversion is that of changing knots to miles\\nper hour. The aviation industry is using knots more\\nfrequently than miles per hour, but it might be well to\\ndiscuss the conversion for those who do use miles per\\nhour when working with speed problems. The\\nNational Weather Service reports both surface winds\\nand winds aloft in knots. However, airspeed indica-\\ntors in some airplanes are calibrated in miles per hour\\n(although many are now calibrated in both miles per\\nhour and knots). Pilots, therefore, should learn to\\nconvert windspeeds in knots to miles per hour.\\nA knot is 1 nautical mile per hour. Because there are\\n6,076.1 feet in a nautical mile and 5,280 feet in a statute\\nmile, the conversion factor is 1.15. To convert knots to\\nmiles per hour, multiply knots by 1.15. For example: a\\nwindspeed of 20 knots is equivalent to 23 miles per\\nhour.\\nMost flight computers or electronic calculators have a\\nmeans of making this conversion. Another quick\\nmethod of conversion is to use the scales of nautical\\nmiles and statute miles at the bottom of aeronautical\\ncharts.\\nFUEL CONSUMPTION\\nAirplane fuel consumption is computed in gallons per\\nhour. Consequently, to determine the fuel required for a\\ngiven flight, the time required for the flight must be\\nknown. Time in flight multiplied by rate of consump-\\ntion gives the quantity of fuel required. For example, a\\nflight of 400 NM at a groundspeed of 100 knots\\nrequires 4 hours. If the plane consumes 5 gallons an\\nhour, the total consumption will be 4 x 5, or 20 gallons.\\nThe rate of fuel consumption depends on many factors:\\ncondition of the engine, propeller pitch, propeller\\nr.p.m., richness of the mixture, and particularly the per-\\ncentage of horsepower used for flight at cruising speed.\\nThe pilot should know the approximate consumption\\nrate from cruise performance charts, or from experi-\\nence. In addition to the amount of fuel required for the\\nflight, there should be sufficient fuel for reserve.\\nFLIGHT COMPUTERS\\nUp to this point, only mathematical formulas have been\\nused to determine such items as time, distance, speed,\\nand fuel consumption. In reality, most pilots will use a\\nmechanical or electronic flight computer. These devices\\ncan compute numerous problems associated with flight\\nplanning and navigation. The mechanical or electronic\\ncomputer will have an instruction book and most likely\\nsample problems so the pilot can become familiar with\\nits functions and operation. [Figure 14-16]\\nPLOTTER\\nAnother aid in flight planning is a plotter, which is a\\nprotractor and ruler.

[Figure 14-16]\\nPILOTAGE\\nPilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks or\\ncheckpoints. It is a method of navigation that can be\\nused on any course that has adequate checkpoints, but\\nit is more commonly used in conjunction with dead\\nreckoning and VFR radio navigation.\\nThe checkpoints selected should be prominent features\\ncommon to the area of the flight. Choose checkpoints\\nthat can be readily identified by other features such as\\nroads, rivers, railroad tracks, lakes, and power lines. If\\npossible, select features that will make useful bound-\\naries or brackets on each side of the course, such as\\nhighways, rivers, railroads, and mountains. A pilot can\\nkeep from drifting too far off course by referring to and\\nnot crossing the selected brackets. Never place com-\\nplete reliance on any single checkpoint. Choose ample\\ncheckpoints. If one is missed, look for the next one\\nwhile maintaining the heading. When determining\\nposition from checkpoints, remember that the scale of a\\nsectional chart is 1 inch = 8 statute miles or 6.86 nauti-\\ncal miles. For example, if a checkpoint selected was\\napproximately one-half inch from the course line on\\nthe chart, it is 4 statue miles or 3.43 nautical miles from\\nthe course on the ground. In the more congested areas,\\nsome of the smaller features are not included on the\\nchart. If confused, hold the heading. If a turn is made\\naway from the heading, it will be easy to become lost.\\nRoads shown on the chart are primarily the well-trav-\\neled roads or those most apparent when viewed from\\nthe air. New roads and structures are constantly being\\nbuilt, and may not be shown on the chart until the next\\nchart is issued. Some structures, such as antennas may\\nbe difficult to see. Sometimes TV antennas are grouped\\ntogether in an area near a town. They are supported by\\nalmost invisible guy wires. Never approach an area of\\nantennas less than 500 feet above the tallest one. Most\\nof the taller structures are marked with strobe lights to\\nmake them more visible to a pilot. However, some\\nweather conditions or background lighting may make\\nthem difficult to see. Aeronautical charts display the\\nbest information available at the time of printing, but a\\npilot should be cautious for new structures or changes\\nthat have occurred since the chart was printed.\\nDEAD RECKONING\\nDead reckoning is navigation solely by means of\\ncomputations based on time, airspeed, distance, and\\ndirection. The products derived from these variables,\\nwhen adjusted by windspeed and velocity, are head-\\ning and groundspeed. The predicted heading will\\nguide the airplane along the intended path and the\\ngroundspeed will establish the time to arrive at each\\ncheckpoint and the destination. Except for flights\\nover water, dead reckoning is usually used with\\npilotage for cross-country flying. The heading and\\ngroundspeed as calculated is constantly monitored\\nand corrected by pilotage as observed from check-\\npoints.\\nTHE WIND TRIANGLE OR\\nVECTOR ANALYSIS\\nIf there is no wind, the airplane’s ground track will be\\nthe same as the heading and the groundspeed will be\\nthe same as the true airspeed. This condition rarely\\nexists. A wind triangle, the pilot’s version of vector\\nanalysis, is the basis of dead reckoning.\\nThe wind triangle is a graphic explanation of the\\neffect of wind upon flight. Groundspeed, heading, and\\ntime for any flight can be determined by using the\\nwind triangle. It can be applied to the simplest kind of\\ncross-country flight as well as the most complicated\\ninstrument flight. The experienced pilot becomes so\\nfamiliar with the fundamental principles that esti-\\nmates can be made which are adequate for visual\\nflight without actually drawing the diagrams. The\\nbeginning student, however, needs to develop skill in\\nconstructing these diagrams as an aid to the complete\\nunderstanding of wind effect. Either consciously or\\nunconsciously, every good pilot thinks of the flight in\\nterms of wind triangle.\\nIf a flight is to be made on a course to the east, with a\\nwind blowing from northeast, the airplane must be\\nheaded somewhat to the north of east to counteract\\ndrift. This can be represented by a diagram as shown in\\nfigure 14-17. Each line represents direction and speed.\\nThe long dotted line shows the direction the plane is\\nheading, and its length represents the airspeed for 1\\nhour. The short dotted line at the right shows the wind\\ndirection, and its length represents the wind velocity\\nN\\nS\\nWind\\nDirection\\nand\\nVelocity\\nHeading and Airspeed\\nCourse and Groundspeed\\nFigure 14-17.

Since the National Weather Service\\nreports the windspeed in knots, if the true airspeed of\\nthe airplane is 120 knots, there is no need to convert\\nspeeds from knots to miles per hour or vice versa.\\nNow on a plain sheet of paper draw a vertical line rep-\\nresenting north and south. (The various steps are shown\\nin figure 14-19.)\\nPlace the protractor with the base resting on the verti-\\ncal line and the curved edge facing east. At the center\\npoint of the base, make a dot labeled “E” (point of\\ndeparture), and at the curved edge, make a dot at 90°\\n(indicating the direction of the true course) and another\\nat 45° (indicating wind direction).\\nWith the ruler, draw the true course line from E,\\nextending it somewhat beyond the dot by 90°, and\\nlabeling it “TC 090°.”\\nNext, align the ruler with E and the dot at 45°, and draw\\nthe wind arrow from E, not toward 045°, but downwind\\nin the direction the wind is blowing, making it 40 units\\nlong, to correspond with the wind velocity of 40 knots.\\nIdentify this line as the wind line by placing the letter\\n“W” at the end to show the wind direction. Finally,\\nmeasure 120 units on the ruler to represent the airspeed,\\nmaking a dot on the ruler at this point. The units used\\nmay be of any convenient scale or value (such as \\n1/4 inch\\n= 10 knots), but once selected, the same scale must be\\nused for each of the linear movements involved. Then\\nplace the ruler so that the end is on the arrowhead (W)\\nand the 120-knot dot intercepts the true course line.\\nDraw the line and label it “AS 120.” The point “P”\\nplaced at the intersection represents the position of the\\nairplane at the end of 1 hour. The diagram is now com-\\nplete.\\nThe distance flown in 1 hour (groundspeed) is meas-\\nured as the numbers of units on the true course line (88\\nnautical miles per hour or 88 knots).\\nThe true heading necessary to offset drift is indicated\\nby the direction of the airspeed line, which can be\\ndetermined in one of two ways:\\n• By placing the straight side of the protractor\\nalong the north-south line, with its center point at\\nWind\\nDirection\\nand\\nVelocity\\nHeading and Airspeed\\nN\\nS\\nE\\nP\\nW\\nCourse\\nand Groundspeed\\nFigure 14-18.

This is the wind correction angle (WCA)\\nwhich must be applied to the true course to obtain\\nthe true heading. If the wind blows from the right\\nof true course, the angle will be added; if from the\\nleft, it will be subtracted.

The compass heading can be used to fly\\nto the destination by dead reckoning.\\nTo determine the time and fuel required for the flight,\\nfirst find the distance to destination by measuring the\\nlength of the course line drawn on the aeronautical\\nchart (using the appropriate scale at the bottom of the\\nchart).

Briefly summarized, the steps in obtaining flight\\ninformation are as follows:\\n• TRUE COURSE— Direction of the line con-\\nnecting two desired points, drawn on the chart\\nand measured clockwise in degrees from true\\nnorth on the mid-meridian.\\n• WIND CORRECTION ANGLE— Determined\\nfrom the wind triangle. (Added to TC if the wind\\nis from the right; subtract if wind is from the left.)\\n• TRUE HEADING— The direction measured in\\ndegrees clockwise from true north, in which the\\nnose of the plane should point to make good the\\ndesired course.\\n• V ARIATION— Obtained from the isogonic line\\non the chart. (Added to TH if west; subtract if\\neast.)\\n• MAGNETIC HEADING— An intermediate\\nstep in the conversion. (Obtained by applying\\nvariation to true heading.)\\n• DEVIATION— Obtained from the deviation\\ncard on the airplane. (Added to MH or subtracted\\nfrom, as indicated.)\\n• COMPASS HEADING— The reading on the\\ncompass (found by applying deviation to MH)\\nwhich will be followed to make good the desired\\ncourse.\\n• TOTAL DISTANCE— Obtained by measuring\\nthe length of the TC line on the chart (using the\\nscale at the bottom of the chart).\\n• GROUNDSPEED— Obtained by measuring the\\nlength of the TC line on the wind triangle (using\\nthe scale employed for drawing the diagram).\\n• ESTIMATED TIME EN ROUTE (ETE)—\\nTotal distance divided by groundspeed.\\n• FUEL RATE— Predetermined gallons per hour\\nused at cruising speed.\\nNOTE: Additional fuel for adequate reserve should be\\nadded as a safety measure.\\nN\\nS\\nE\\nW\\nTC 090° GS 88\\nTH 076° AS 120\\nWCA = 14° L\\n14°\\nP\\nFigure 14-21.

The\\nfollowing sections will provide a logical sequence to\\nfollow in charting the course, filling out a flight log,\\nand filing a flight plan. In the following example, a trip\\nis planned based on the following data and the sectional\\nchart excerpt in figure 14-23.\\nRoute of flight: Chickasha Airport direct to Guthrie\\nAirport\\nTrue Airspeed (TAS)...............................115 knots\\nWinds Aloft.....................................360° at 10 knots\\nUsable fuel...........................................38 gallons\\nFuel Rate....................................................8 GPH\\nDeviation.............................................................+2°\\nSTEPS IN CHARTING THE COURSE\\nThe following is a suggested sequence for arriving at\\nthe pertinent information for the trip. As information is\\ndetermined, it may be noted as illustrated in the exam-\\nple of a flight log in figure 14-24. Where calculations\\nare required, the pilot may use a mathematical formula\\nor a manual or electronic flight computer. If unfamiliar\\nwith how to use a manual or electronic computer com-\\npetently, it would be advantageous to read the opera-\\ntion manual and work several practice problems at this\\npoint.\\nFirst draw a line from Chickasha Airport (point A)\\ndirectly to Guthrie Airport (point F). The course line\\nshould begin at the center of the airport of departure\\nand end at the center of the destination airport. If the\\nroute is direct, the course line will consist of a single\\nstraight line. If the route is not direct, it will consist of\\ntwo or more straight line segments—for example, a\\nVOR station which is off the direct route, but which\\nwill make navigating easier, may be chosen (radio nav-\\nigation is discussed later in this chapter).\\nAppropriate checkpoints should be selected along the\\nroute and noted in some way. These should be easy-to-\\nlocate points such as large towns, large lakes and rivers,\\nor combinations of recognizable points such as towns\\nwith an airport, towns with a network of highways, and\\nrailroads entering and departing. Normally, choose\\nonly towns indicated by splashes of yellow on the\\nchart. Do not choose towns represented by a small cir-\\ncle—these may turn out to be only a half-dozen houses.\\n(In isolated areas, however, towns represented by a\\nsmall circle can be prominent checkpoints.) For this\\ntrip, four checkpoints have been selected. Checkpoint 1\\nconsists of a tower located east of the course and can be\\nfurther identified by the highway and railroad track,\\nwhich almost parallels the course at this point.\\nCheckpoint 2 is the obstruction just to the west of the\\ncourse and can be further identified by Will Rogers\\nAirport which is directly to the east. Checkpoint 3 is\\nWiley Post Airport, which the airplane should fly\\ndirectly over. Checkpoint 4 is a private non-surfaced\\nairport to the west of the course and can be further iden-\\ntified by the railroad track and highway to the east of\\nthe course.\\nThe course and areas on either side of the planned route\\nshould be checked to determine if there is any type of\\nairspace with which the pilot should be concerned or\\nwhich has special operational requirements. For this\\ntrip, it should be noted that the course will pass through\\na segment of the Class C airspace surrounding Will\\nRogers Airport where the floor of the airspace is 2,500\\nfeet mean sea level (MSL) and the ceiling is 5,300 feet\\nMSL (point B). Also, there is Class D airspace from the\\nsurface to 3,800 feet MSL surrounding Wiley Post\\nAirport (point C) during the time the control tower is in\\noperation.\\nStudy the terrain and obstructions along the route.\\nThis is necessary to determine the highest and lowest\\nelevations as well as the highest obstruction to be\\nencountered so that an appropriate altitude which will\\nconform to part 91 regulations can be selected. If the\\nflight is to be flown at an altitude more than 3,000 feet\\nabove the terrain, conformance to the cruising altitude\\nappropriate to the direction of flight is required.\\nCheck the route for particularly rugged terrain so it\\ncan be avoided. Areas where a takeoff or landing will\\nbe made should be carefully checked for tall obstruc-\\ntions. TV transmitting towers may extend to altitudes\\nover 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain. It is\\nessential that pilots be aware of their presence and\\nlocation. For this trip, it should be noted that the\\ntallest obstruction is part of a series of antennas with a\\nheight of 2,749 feet MSL (point D). The highest ele-\\nvation should be located in the northeast quadrant and\\nis 2,900 feet MSL (point E).\\nSince the wind is no factor and it is desirable and within\\nthe airplane’s capability to fly above the Class C and D\\nairspace to be encountered, an altitude of 5,500 feet\\nMSL will be chosen. This altitude also gives adequate\\nclearance of all obstructions as well as conforms to the\\npart 91 requirement to fly at an altitude of odd thou-\\nsand plus 500 feet when on a magnetic course between\\n0 and 179°.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-14'),\n",

The\\ntotal distance is 53 NM and the distance between check-\\npoints is as noted on the flight log in figure 14-24.\\nAfter determining the distance, the true course should\\nbe measured. If using a plotter, follow the directions on\\nthe plotter. The true course is 031°. Once the true head-\\ning is established, the pilot can determine the compass\\nheading. This is done by following the formula given\\nearlier in this chapter. The formula is:\\nTC ± WCA = TH ± V AR = MH ± DEV = CH\\nThe wind correction angle can be determined by using\\na manual or electronic flight computer. Using a wind of\\n360° at 10 knots, it is determined the WCA is 3° left.\\nThis is subtracted from the TC making the TH 28°.\\nNext, the pilot should locate the isogonic line closest to\\nthe route of the flight to determine variation. Point G in\\nfigure 14-23 shows the variation to be 6° 30 �E\\n(rounded to 7°E), which means it should be subtracted\\nfrom the TH, giving an MH of 21°. Next, add 2° to the\\nMH for the deviation correction. This gives the pilot\\nthe compass heading which is 23°.\\nNext, the groundspeed should be determined. This can\\nbe done using a manual or electronic calculator. It is\\ndetermined the GS is 106 knots. Based on this infor-\\nmation, the total trip time, as well as time between\\ncheckpoints, and the fuel burned can be determined.\\nThese calculations can be done mathematically or by\\nusing a manual or electronic calculator.\\nFor this trip, the GS is 106 knots and the total time is\\n35 minutes (30 minutes plus 5 minutes for climb) with\\na fuel burn of 4.7 gallons. Refer to the flight log in fig-\\nure 14-24 for the time between checkpoints.\\nAs the trip progresses, the pilot can note headings and\\ntime and make adjustments in heading, groundspeed,\\nand time.\\nFILING A VFR FLIGHT PLAN\\nFiling a flight plan is not required by regulations;\\nhowever, it is a good operating practice, since the\\ninformation contained in the flight plan can be used in\\nsearch and rescue in the event of an emergency.\\nFlight plans can be filed in the air by radio, but it is best\\nto file a flight plan either in person at the FSS or by\\nphone just before departing.

To aid in\\norientation, a compass rose reference to magnetic\\nnorth is superimposed on aeronautical charts at the\\nstation location.\\nVOR ground stations transmit within a VHF frequency\\nband of 108.0 – 117.95 MHz. Because the equipment is\\nVHF, the signals transmitted are subject to line-of-sight\\nrestrictions. Therefore, its range varies in direct propor-\\ntion to the altitude of receiving equipment. Generally,\\nthe reception range of the signals at an altitude of 1,000\\nfeet above ground level (AGL) is about 40 to 45 miles.\\nThis distance increases with altitude.

This is particularly true at great distances\\nfrom the VOR station. The best assurance of main-\\ntaining an accurate VOR receiver is periodic checks\\nand calibrations. VOR accuracy checks are not a reg-\\nulatory requirement for VFR flight. However, to\\nassure accuracy of the equipment, these checks should\\nbe accomplished quite frequently along with a com-\\nplete calibration each year. The following means are\\nprovided for pilots to check VOR accuracy:\\n• FAA VOR test facility (VOT);\\n• certified airborne checkpoints;\\n• certified ground checkpoints located on airport sur-\\nfaces.\\nIf dual VOR is installed in the airplane and tuned to the\\nsame VOR ground facility, the maximum permissible\\nvariation between the two indicated bearings is 4°.\\nA list of these checkpoints is published in the\\nAirport/Facility Directory.\\nBasically, these checks consist of verifying that the\\nVOR radials the airplane equipment receives are\\naligned with the radials the station transmits. There are\\nnot specific tolerances in VOR checks required for\\nVFR flight. But as a guide to assure acceptable accu-\\nracy, the required IFR tolerances can be used which are\\n±4° for ground checks and ±6° for airborne checks.\\nThese checks can be performed by the pilot.\\nThe VOR transmitting station can be positively identi-\\nfied by its Morse code identification or by a recorded\\nvoice identification which states the name of the station\\nfollowed by the word “VOR.” Many Flight Service\\nStations transmit voice messages on the same frequency\\nthat the VOR operates. V oice transmissions should not\\nbe relied upon to identify stations, because many FSSs\\nremotely transmit over several omniranges, which have\\ndifferent names than the transmitting FSS. If the VOR is\\nout of service for maintenance, the coded identification\\nis removed and not transmitted. This serves to alert pilots\\nthat this station should not be used for navigation. VOR\\nreceivers are designed with an alarm flag to indicate\\nwhen signal strength is inadequate to operate the naviga-\\ntional equipment. This happens if the airplane is too far\\nfrom the VOR or the airplane is too low and therefore, is\\nout of the line-of-sight of the transmitting signals.\\nUSING THE VOR\\nIn review, for VOR radio navigation, there are two\\ncomponents required: the ground transmitter and the\\nairplane receiving equipment. The ground transmitter\\nis located at a specific position on the ground and trans-\\nmits on an assigned frequency. The airplane equipment\\nincludes a receiver with a tuning device and a VOR or\\nomninavigation instrument. The navigation instrument\\nconsists of (1) an omnibearing selector (OBS) some-\\ntimes referred to as the course selector, (2) a course\\ndeviation indicator needle (Left-Right Needle), and (3)\\na TO-FROM indicator.\\nThe course selector is an azimuth dial that can be\\nrotated to select a desired radial or to determine the\\nradial over which the airplane is flying. In addition, the\\nmagnetic course “TO” or “FROM” the station can be\\ndetermined.\\nWhen the course selector is rotated, it moves the course\\ndeviation indicator (CDI) or needle to indicate the posi-\\ntion of the radial relative to the airplane. If the course\\nselector is rotated until the deviation needle is centered,\\nthe radial (magnetic course “FROM” the station) or its\\nreciprocal (magnetic course “TO” the station) can be\\ndetermined. The course deviation needle will also\\nmove to the right or left if the airplane is flown or drift-\\ning away from the radial which is set in the course\\nselector.\\nBy centering the needle, the course selector will indi-\\ncate either the course “FROM” the station or the course\\n“TO” the station. If the flag displays a “TO,” the course\\nshown on the course selector must be flown to the sta-\\ntion.[Figure 14-27] If “FROM” is displayed and the\\ncourse shown is followed, the airplane will be flown\\naway from the station.\\n0\\n3\\n6\\n9\\n12\\n1518\\n21\\n24\\n27\\n30\\n33\\nTO\\nFR\\nOBS\\nFigure 14-27.

Figure\\n14-28 illustrates the discussion:\\nFirst, tune the VOR receiver to the frequency of the\\nselected VOR station. For example: 115.0 to receive\\nBravo VOR. Next, check the identifiers to verify that\\nthe desired VOR is being received. As soon as the VOR\\nis properly tuned, the course deviation needle will\\ndeflect either left or right; then rotate the azimuth dial\\nto the course selector until the course deviation needle\\ncenters and the TO-FROM indicates “TO.” If the nee-\\ndle centers with a “FROM” indication, the azimuth\\nshould be rotated 180° because, in this case, it is\\ndesired to fly “TO” the station. Now, turn the airplane\\nto the heading indicated on the VOR azimuth dial or\\ncourse selector. In this example 350°.\\nIf a heading of 350° is maintained with a wind from the\\nright as shown, the airplane will drift to the left of the\\nintended track. As the airplane drifts off course, the\\nVOR course deviation needle will gradually move to\\nthe right of center or indicate the direction of the\\ndesired radial or track.\\nTo return to the desired radial, the airplane heading\\nmust be altered to the right. As the airplane returns to\\nthe desired track, the deviation needle will slowly\\nreturn to center. When centered, the airplane will be on\\nthe desired radial and a left turn must be made toward,\\nbut not to the original heading of 350° because a wind\\ndrift correction must be established. The amount of cor-\\nrection depends upon the strength of the wind. If the\\nwind velocity is unknown, a trial and error method can\\nbe used to find the correct heading. Assume, for this\\nexample, a 10° correction or a heading of 360° is main-\\ntained.\\nWhile maintaining a heading of 360°, assume that the\\ncourse deviation begins to move to the left. This means\\nthat the wind correction of 10° is too great and the air-\\nplane is flying to the right of course. A slight turn to the\\nleft should be made to permit the airplane to return to\\nthe desired radial.\\nWhen the deviation needle centers, a small wind drift\\ncorrection of 5° or a heading correction of 355° should\\nbe flown. If this correction is adequate, the airplane\\nwill remain on the radial. If not, small variation in\\nheading should be made to keep the needle centered,\\nand consequently keep the airplane on the radial.\\nAs the VOR station is passed, the course deviation nee-\\ndle will fluctuate, then settle down, and the “TO” indi-\\ncation will change to “FROM.” If the airplane passes to\\none side of the station, the needle will deflect in the\\ndirection of the station as the indicator changes to\\n“FROM.”\\nGenerally, the same techniques apply when tracking\\noutbound as those used for tracking inbound. If the\\nintent is to fly over the station and track outbound on\\nthe reciprocal of the inbound radial, the course selector\\nshould not be changed. Corrections are made in the\\nsame manner to keep the needle centered. The only dif-\\nference is that the omni will indicate “FROM.”\\nIf tracking outbound on a course other than the recipro-\\ncal of the inbound radial, this new course or radial must\\nbe set in the course selector and a turn made to inter-\\ncept this course. After this course is reached, tracking\\nprocedures are the same as previously discussed.\\n350°\\nFROM\\n350°\\nFROM\\n040°\\nFROM\\n350°\\nTO\\n355°\\n040°\\n355°\\n355°\\n350°\\nTO\\n350°\\nTO\\n350°\\nTO\\n020°\\n350°\\n360°\\n360°\\n350°\\nTO\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\n6.\\n7.\\n8.\\nWIND\\nBRAVO\\nBRA 115.0\\n0\\n18\\n27\\n6\\nFigure 14-28.

If the airplane\\ndrifts, do not reset the course selector, but correct\\nfor drift and fly a heading that will compensate\\nfor wind drift.\\n• If minor needle fluctuations occur, avoid chang-\\ning headings immediately. Wait momentarily to\\nsee if the needle recenters; if it doesn’t, then\\ncorrect.\\n• When flying “TO” a station, always fly the\\nselected course with a “TO” indication. When fly-\\ning “FROM” a station, always fly the selected\\ncourse with a “FROM” indication. If this is not\\ndone, the action of the course deviation needle will\\nbe reversed. To further explain this reverse action,\\nif the airplane is flown toward a station with a\\n“FROM” indication or away from a station with a\\n“TO” indication, the course deviation needle will\\nindicate in an opposite direction to that which it\\nshould. For example, if the airplane drifts to the\\nright of a radial being flown, the needle will move\\nto the right or point away from the radial. If the\\nairplane drifts to the left of the radial being flown,\\nthe needle will move left or in the opposite direc-\\ntion of the radial.\\nDISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT\\nDistance measuring equipment (DME) is an ultra high\\nfrequency (UHF) navigational aid present with\\nVOR/DMEs and VORTACs. It measures, in nautical\\nmiles (NM), the slant range distance of an airplane\\nfrom a VOR/DME or VORTAC (both hereafter\\nreferred to as a VORTAC). Although DME equipment\\nis very popular, not all airplanes are DME equipped.\\nTo utilize DME, the pilot should select, tune, and iden-\\ntify a VORTAC, as previously described. The DME\\nreceiver, utilizing what is called a “paired frequency”\\nconcept, automatically selects and tunes the UHF DME\\nfrequency associated with the VHF VORTAC fre-\\nquency selected by the pilot. This process is entirely\\ntransparent to the pilot. After a brief pause, the DME\\ndisplay will show the slant range distance to or from\\nthe VORTAC. Slant range distance is the direct dis-\\ntance between the airplane and the VORTAC, and is\\ntherefore affected by airplane altitude. (Station passage\\ndirectly over a VORTAC from an altitude of 6,076 feet\\nabove ground level (AGL) would show approximately\\n1.0 NM on the DME.) DME is a very useful adjunct to\\nVOR navigation. A VOR radial alone merely gives line\\nof position information. With DME, a pilot may pre-\\ncisely locate the airplane on that line (radial).\\nMost DME receivers also provide groundspeed\\nand time-to-station modes of operation. The\\ngroundspeed is displayed in knots (NM per hour). The\\ntime-to-station mode displays the minutes\\nremaining to VORTAC station passage, predicated\\nupon the present groundspeed. Groundspeed and\\ntime-to-station information is only accurate when\\ntracking directly to or from a VORTAC. DME\\nreceivers typically need a minute or two of stabilized\\nflight directly to or from a VORTAC before dis-\\nplaying accurate groundspeed or time-to-station\\ninformation.\\nSome DME installations have a hold feature that per-\\nmits a DME signal to be retained from one VORTAC\\nwhile the course indicator displays course deviation\\ninformation from an ILS or another VORTAC.\\nVOR/DME RNAV\\nArea navigation (RNAV) permits electronic course\\nguidance on any direct route between points estab-\\nlished by the pilot. While RNA V is a generic term that\\napplies to a variety of navigational aids, such as\\nLORAN-C, GPS, and others, this section will deal\\nwith VOR/DME-based RNAV. VOR/DME RNAV is\\nnot a separate ground-based NA V AID, but a method of\\nnavigation using VOR/DME and VORTAC signals\\nspecially processed by the airplane’s RNA V computer. \\n[Figure 14-29] Note: In this section, the term “VORTAC” also\\nincludes VOR/DME NAVAIDs.\\nIn its simplest form, VOR/DME RNA V allows the pilot\\nto electronically move VORTACs around to more con-\\nvenient locations. Once electronically relocated, they are\\nreferred to as waypoints. These waypoints are described\\nas a combination of a selected radial and distance within\\nthe service volume of the VORTAC to be used. These\\nwaypoints allow a straight course to be flown between\\nalmost any origin and destination, without regard to the\\norientation of VORTACs or the existence of airways.\\nArea Navigation\\nDirect Route\\nFIGURE 14-29.

Pilots are\\nurged to study the manufacturer’s operating guide and\\nreceive instruction prior to the use of VOR/DME\\nRNAV or any unfamiliar navigational system.\\nOperational information and limitations should also be\\nsought from placards and the supplement section of the\\nAirplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating\\nHandbook (AFM/POH).\\nVOR/DME-based RNA V units operate in at least three\\nmodes: VOR, En Route, and Approach. A fourth mode,\\nVOR Parallel, may also be found on some models. The\\nunits need both VOR and DME signals to operate in\\nany RNAV mode. If the NAVAID selected is a VOR\\nwithout DME, RNA V mode will not function.\\nIn the VOR (or non-RNAV) mode, the unit simply\\nfunctions as a VOR receiver with DME capability.\\n[Figure 14-30] The unit’s display on the VOR indicator\\nis conventional in all respects. For operation on estab-\\nlished airways or any other ordinary VOR navigation,\\nthe VOR mode is used.\\nTo utilize the unit’s RNA V capability, the pilot selects\\nand establishes a waypoint or a series of waypoints to\\ndefine a course. To operate in any RNA V mode, the unit\\nneeds both radial and distance signals; therefore, a\\nVORTAC (or VOR/DME) needs to be selected as a\\nNA V AID. To establish a waypoint, a point somewhere\\nwithin the service range of a VORTAC is defined on\\nthe basis of radial and distance. Once the waypoint is\\nentered into the unit and the RNA V En Route mode is\\nselected, the CDI will display course guidance to the\\nwaypoint, not the original VORTAC. DME will also\\ndisplay distance to the waypoint. Many units have the\\ncapability to store several waypoints, allowing them to\\nbe programmed prior to flight, if desired, and called up\\nin flight.\\nRNA V waypoints are entered into the unit in magnetic\\nbearings (radials) of degrees and tenths (i.e., 275.5°)\\nand distances in nautical miles and tenths (i.e., 25.2\\nNM). When plotting RNA V waypoints on an aeronau-\\ntical chart, pilots will find it difficult to measure to that\\nlevel of accuracy, and in practical application, it is\\nrarely necessary. A number of flight planning publica-\\ntions publish airport coordinates and waypoints with\\nthis precision and the unit will accept those figures.\\nThere is a subtle, but important difference in CDI oper-\\nation and display in the RNA V modes.\\nIn the RNA V modes, course deviation is displayed in\\nterms of linear deviation. In the RNA V En Route mode,\\nmaximum deflection of the CDI typically represents 5\\nNM on either side of the selected course, without\\nregard to distance from the waypoint. In the RNAV\\nApproach mode, maximum deflection of the CDI typi-\\ncally represents 1 \\n1/4 NM on either side of the selected\\ncourse. There is no increase in CDI sensitivity as the\\nairplane approaches a waypoint in RNA V mode.\\nThe RNAV Approach mode is used for instrument\\napproaches. Its narrow scale width (one-quarter of the\\nEn Route mode) permits very precise tracking to or\\nfrom the selected waypoint. In visual flight rules (VFR)\\ncross-country navigation, tracking a course in the\\nApproach mode is not desirable because it requires a\\ngreat deal of attention and soon becomes tedious.\\nA fourth, lesser-used mode on some units is the\\nVOR Parallel mode. This permits the CDI to display\\nlinear (not angular) deviation as the airplane tracks\\nto and from VORTACs. It derives its name from per-\\nmitting the pilot to offset (or parallel) a selected\\ncourse or airway at a fixed distance of the pilot’s\\nchoosing, if desired. The VOR Parallel mode has the\\nsame effect as placing a waypoint directly over an\\nexisting VORTAC. Some pilots select the VOR\\nParallel mode when utilizing the navigation (NAV)\\ntracking function of their autopilot for smoother\\ncourse following near the VORTAC.\\nConfusion is possible when navigating an airplane\\nwith VOR/DME-based RNAV, and it is essential\\nthat the pilot become familiar with the equipment\\ninstalled. It is not unknown for pilots to operate\\ninadvertently in one of the RNAV modes when the\\noperation was not intended by overlooking switch\\npositions or annunciators. The reverse has also\\noccurred with a pilot neglecting to place the unit\\ninto one of the RNAV modes by overlooking switch\\npositions or annunciators. As always, the prudent\\npilot is not only familiar with the equipment used,\\nbut never places complete reliance in just one\\nmethod of navigation when others are available for\\ncross-check.\\nAUTOMATIC DIRECTION FINDER\\nMany general aviation-type airplanes are equipped\\nwith automatic direction finder (ADF) radio receiving\\nequipment. To navigate using the ADF, the pilot tunes\\nthe receiving equipment to a ground station known as a\\nNONDIRECTIONAL RADIOBEACON (NDB). The\\nNDB stations normally operate in a low or medium fre-\\nquency band of 200 to 415 kHz. The frequencies are\\nFIGURE 14-30. RNAV controls.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-22'),\n",

Pilots should know the\\nconditions under which these disturbances can occur so\\nthey can be more alert to possible interference when\\nusing the ADF.\\nBasically, the ADF airplane equipment consists of a\\ntuner, which is used to set the desired station frequency,\\nand the navigational display.\\nThe navigational display consists of a dial upon which\\nthe azimuth is printed, and a needle which rotates\\naround the dial and points to the station to which the\\nreceiver is tuned.\\nSome of the ADF dials can be rotated so as to align the\\nazimuth with the airplane heading; others are fixed\\nwith 0° representing the nose of the airplane, and 180°\\nrepresenting the tail.

This means that in still air\\na magnetic heading of approximately 190° would\\nbe flown to the station. If the total is greater than\\n360°, subtract 360° from the total to obtain the\\nmagnetic bearing to the station. For example, if the\\nrelative bearing is 270° and magnetic heading is\\n300°, 360° is subtracted from the total, or 570° –\\n360° = 210°, which is the magnetic bearing to the\\nstation.\\nTo determine the magnetic bearing “FROM” the\\nstation, 180° is added to or subtracted from the\\nmagnetic bearing to the station. This is the reciprocal\\nbearing and is used when plotting position fixes.\\nKeep in mind that the needle of fixed azimuth points to\\nthe station in relation to the nose of the airplane. If the\\nneedle is deflected 30° to the left or a relative bearing\\nof 330°, this means that the station is located 30° left. If\\nthe airplane is turned left 30°, the needle will move to\\nthe right 30° and indicate a relative bearing of 0° or the\\nairplane will be pointing toward the station. If the pilot\\ncontinues flight toward the station keeping the needle\\non 0°, the procedure is called homing to the station. If a\\ncrosswind exists, the ADF needle will continue to drift\\naway from zero. To keep the needle on zero, the\\nairplane must be turned slightly resulting in a curved\\nflightpath to the station. Homing to the station is a\\ncommon procedure, but results in drifting downwind,\\nthus lengthening the distance to the station.\\nTracking to the station requires correcting for wind\\ndrift and results in maintaining flight along a straight\\ntrack or bearing to the station. When the wind drift cor-\\nrection is established, the ADF needle will indicate the\\namount of correction to the right or left. For instance, if\\nthe magnetic bearing to the station is 340°, a correction\\nfor a left crosswind would result in a magnetic heading\\nof 330°, and the ADF needle would indicate 10° to the\\nright or a relative bearing of 010°. [Figure 14-33]\\nWhen tracking away from the station, wind corrections\\nare made similar to tracking to the station, but the ADF\\nneedle points toward the tail of the airplane or the 180°\\nposition on the azimuth dial. Attempting to keep the\\nADF needle on the 180° position during winds results\\nin the airplane flying a curved flight leading further and\\nfurther from the desired track.

World Aeronautical Chart\\n(WAC), Sectional Charts, and VFR Terminal Area\\nCharts do not show the presence of LORAN-C\\ntransmitters. Selection of a transmitter chain is either\\nmade automatically by the unit, or manually by the\\npilot using guidance information provided by the\\nmanufacturer. LORAN-C is a highly accurate, supple-\\nmental form of navigation typically installed as an\\nadjunct to VOR and ADF equipment. Databases of\\nairports, NA V AIDs, and air traffic control facilities are\\nfrequently features of LORAN-C receivers.\\nLORAN-C is an outgrowth of the original LORAN-A\\ndeveloped for navigation during World War II. The\\nLORAN-C system is used extensively in maritime\\napplications.

These units are frequently very\\nsophisticated and capable, with a wide variety of\\nnavigational functions.\\nWith high levels of LORAN-C sophistication and\\ncapability, a certain complexity in operation is an\\nunfortunate necessity. Pilots are urged to read the\\noperating handbooks and to consult the supplements\\nsection of the AFM/POH prior to utilizing LORAN-C\\nfor navigation. Many units offer so many features that\\nthe manufacturers often publish two different sets of\\ninstructions:  (1) a brief operating guide and (2)\\nin-depth operating manual.\\nWhile coverage is not global, LORAN-C signals are\\nsuitable for navigation in all of the conterminous\\nUnited States, and parts of Canada and Alaska. Several\\nforeign countries also operate their own LORAN-C\\nsystems. In the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard\\noperates the LORAN-C system. LORAN-C system\\nstatus is available from:  USCG Navigation Center,\\nAlexandria, V A (703) 313-5900.\\nLORAN-C absolute accuracy is excellent—position\\nerrors are typically less than .25 NM. Repeatable\\naccuracy, or the ability to return to a waypoint\\npreviously visited, is even better. While LORAN-C is a\\nform of RNAV, it differs significantly from\\nVOR/DME-based RNA V . It operates in a 90 – 110 kHz\\nfrequency range and is based upon measurement of the\\ndifference in arrival times of pulses of radio frequency\\n(RF) energy emitted by a chain of transmitters\\nhundreds of miles apart.\\nWithin any given chain of transmitters, there is a\\nmaster station, and from three to five secondary\\nstations. LORAN-C units must be able to receive at\\nleast a master and two secondary stations to provide\\nnavigational information. Unlike VOR/DME-based\\nRNAV, where the pilot must select the appropriate\\nVOR/DME or VORTAC frequency, there is not a\\nfrequency selection in LORAN-C. The most advanced\\nunits automatically select the optimum chain for\\nnavigation. Other units rely upon the pilot to select the\\nappropriate chain with a manual entry.\\nAfter the LORAN-C receiver has been turned on, the\\nunit must be initialized before it can be used for\\nnavigation. While this can be accomplished in flight, it\\nis preferable to perform this task, which can take\\nseveral minutes, on the ground. The methods for\\ninitialization are as varied as the number of different\\nmodels of receivers. Some require pilot input during\\nthe process, such as verification or acknowledgment of\\nthe information displayed.\\nMost units contain databases of navigational\\ninformation. Frequently, such databases contain not\\nonly airport and NA V AID locations, but also extensive\\nairport, airspace, and ATC information. While the unit\\nwill operate with an expired database, the information\\nshould be current or verified to be correct prior to use.\\nThe pilot can update some databases, while others\\nrequire removal from the airplane and the services of\\nan avionics technician.\\nVFR navigation with LORAN-C can be as simple as\\ntelling the unit where the pilot wishes to go. The course\\nguidance provided will be a great circle (shortest\\ndistance) route to the destination. Older units may need\\na destination entered in terms of latitude and longitude,\\nbut recent designs only need the identifier of the airport\\nor NA V AID. The unit will also permit database storage\\nand retrieval of pilot defined waypoints. LORAN-C\\nsignals follow the curvature of the Earth and\\nare generally usable hundreds of miles from\\ntheir transmitters.\\nThe LORAN-C signal is subject to degradation from a\\nvariety of atmospheric disturbances. It is also\\nsusceptible to interference from static electricity\\nbuildup on the airframe and electrically “noisy”\\nairframe equipment. Flight in precipitation or even dust\\nclouds can cause occasional interference with\\nnavigational guidance from LORAN-C signals. To\\nminimize these effects, static wicks and bonding straps\\nshould be installed and properly maintained. \\nLORAN-C navigation information is presented to the\\npilot in a variety of ways. All units have self-contained\\ndisplays, and some elaborate units feature built-in\\nmoving map displays. Some installations can also drive\\nan external moving map display, a conventional VOR\\nindicator, or a horizontal situation indicator (HSI).\\nCourse deviation information is presented as a linear\\ndeviation from course—there is no increase in tracking\\nsensitivity as the airplane approaches the waypoint or\\ndestination. Pilots must carefully observe placards,\\nselector switch positions, and annunciator indications\\nwhen utilizing LORAN-C because airplane\\ninstallations can vary widely. The pilot’s familiarity\\nwith unit operation through AFM/POH supplements\\nand operating guides cannot be overemphasized.\\nLORAN-C Notices To Airmen (NOTAMs) should be\\nreviewed prior to relying on LORAN-C for navigation.\\nLORAN-C NOTAMs will be issued to announce\\noutages for specific chains and transmitters. Pilots may\\nobtain LORAN-C NOTAMs from FSS briefers only\\nupon request.\\nThe prudent pilot will never rely solely on one means\\nof navigation when others are available for backup and\\ncross-check.

Its RNA V guidance is\\nworldwide in scope. There are no symbols for GPS on\\naeronautical charts as it is a space-based system with\\nglobal coverage. Development of the system is\\nunderway so that GPS will be capable of providing the\\nprimary means of electronic navigation. Portable and\\nyoke mounted units are proving to be very popular in\\naddition to those permanently installed in the airplane.\\nExtensive navigation databases are common features in\\nairplane GPS receivers.\\nThe GPS is a satellite radio navigation and time\\ndissemination system developed and operated by the\\nU.S. Department of Defense (DOD). Civilian interface\\nand GPS system status is available from the U.S.\\nCoast Guard.\\nIt is not necessary to understand the technical aspects\\nof GPS operation to use it in VFR/instrument flight\\nrules (IFR) navigation. It does differ significantly from\\nconventional, ground-based electronic navigation, and\\nawareness of those differences is important. Awareness\\nof equipment approvals and limitations is critical to the\\nsafety of flight. The GPS system is composed of three\\nmajor elements:\\n1. The space segment is composed of a constella-\\ntion of 26 satellites orbiting approximately\\n10,900 NM above the Earth. The operational\\nsatellites are often referred to as the GPS\\nconstellation. The satellites are not\\ngeosynchronous but instead orbit the Earth in\\nperiods of approximately 12 hours. Each\\nsatellite is equipped with highly stable atomic\\nclocks and transmits a unique code and\\nnavigation message. Transmitting in the UHF\\nrange means that the signals are virtually\\nunaffected by weather although they are\\nsubject to line-of-sight limitations. The\\nsatellites must be above the horizon (as seen\\nby the receiver’s antenna) to be usable\\nfor navigation.\\n2. The control segment consists of a master\\ncontrol station at Falcon AFB, Colorado\\nSprings, CO, five monitor stations, and three\\nground antennas. The monitor stations and\\nground antennas are distributed around the\\nEarth to allow continual monitoring and\\ncommunications with the satellites. Updates\\nand corrections to the navigational message\\nbroadcast by each satellite are uplinked\\nto the satellites as they pass over the\\nground antennas.\\n3. The user segment consists of all components\\nassociated with the GPS receiver, ranging\\nfrom portable, hand-held receivers to receivers\\npermanently installed in the airplane. The\\nreceiver matches the satellite’s coded signal by\\nshifting its own identical code in a matching\\nprocess to precisely measure the time of\\narrival. Knowing the speed the signal traveled\\n(approximately 186,000 miles per second) and\\nthe exact broadcast time, the distance traveled\\nby the signal can be inferred from its\\narrival time.\\nTo solve for its location, the GPS receiver utilizes the\\nsignals of at least four of the best-positioned satellites\\nto yield a three-dimensional fix (latitude, longitude,\\nand altitude). A two-dimensional fix (latitude and\\nlongitude only) can be determined with as few as three\\nsatellites. GPS receivers have extensive databases.\\nDatabases are provided initially by the receiver\\nmanufacturer and updated by the manufacturer or a\\ndesignated data agency.\\nA wide variety of GPS receivers with extensive\\nnavigation capabilities are available. Panel mounted\\nunits permanently installed in the airplane may be used\\nfor VFR and may also have certain IFR approvals.\\nPortable hand-held and yoke mounted GPS receivers\\nare also popular, although these are limited to VFR use.\\nNot all GPS receivers on the market are suited for air\\nnavigation. Marine, recreational, and surveying units,\\nfor example, are not suitable for airplane use. As with\\nLORAN-C receivers, GPS unit features and operating\\nprocedures vary widely. The pilot must be familiar with\\nthe manufacturer’s operating guide. Placards,\\nswitch positions, and annunciators should be\\ncarefully observed.\\nInitialization of the unit will require several minutes\\nand should be accomplished prior to flight. If the unit\\nhas not been operated for several months or if it has\\nbeen moved to a significantly different location (by\\nseveral hundred miles) while off, this may require\\nseveral additional minutes. During initialization, the\\nunit will make internal integrity checks, acquire\\nsatellite signals, and display the database revision date.\\nWhile the unit will operate with an expired database,\\nthe database should be current, or verified to be\\ncorrect, prior to relying on it for navigation.\\nVFR navigation with GPS can be as simple as selecting\\na destination (an airport, VOR, NDB, intersection, or\\npilot defined waypoint) and placing the unit in the\\nnavigation mode. Course guidance provided will be a\\ngreat circle route (shortest distance) direct to the\\ndestination. Many units provide advisory information\\nabout special use airspace and minimum safe altitudes,\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-26'),\n",

Users having prior experience with\\nLORAN-C receivers will note many similarities in the\\nwealth of navigation information available, although\\nthe technical principles of operation are quite different.\\nAll GPS receivers have integral (built into the unit)\\nnavigation displays and some feature integral moving\\nmap displays. Some panel-mounted units will drive a\\nVOR indicator, HSI, or even an external moving map\\ndisplay. GPS course deviation is linear—there is not an\\nincrease in tracking sensitivity as the airplane\\napproaches a waypoint. Pilots must carefully observe\\nplacards, selector switch positions, and annunciator\\nindications when utilizing GPS as installations and\\napprovals can vary widely.\\nThe integral GPS navigation display (like most\\nLORAN-C units) uses several additional navigational\\nterms beyond those used in NDB and VOR navigation.\\nSome of these terms, whose abbreviations vary among\\nmanufacturers, are shown below. The pilot should\\nconsult the manufacturer’s operating guide for\\nspecific definitions.\\nNOTAMs should be reviewed prior to relying on GPS\\nfor navigation. GPS NOTAMs will be issued to\\nannounce outages for specific GPS satellites by\\npseudorandom noise code (PRN) and satellite vehicle\\nnumber (SVN). Pilots may obtain GPS NOTAMs from\\nFSS briefers only upon request.\\nWhen using any sophisticated and highly capable\\nnavigation system, such as LORAN-C or GPS, there is\\na strong temptation to rely almost exclusively on that\\nunit, to the detriment of using other techniques of\\nposition keeping. The prudent pilot will never rely on\\none means of navigation when others are available for\\ncross-check and backup.\\nLOST PROCEDURES\\nGetting lost in an airplane is a potentially dangerous\\nsituation especially when low on fuel. If a pilot\\nbecomes lost, there are some good common sense\\nprocedures to follow. If a town or city cannot be seen,\\nthe first thing to do is climb, being mindful of traffic\\nand weather conditions. An increase in altitude\\nincreases radio and navigation reception range, and\\nalso increases radar coverage. If flying near a town or\\ncity, it might be possible to read the name of the town\\non a water tower.\\nIf the airplane has a navigational radio, such as a VOR\\nor ADF receiver, it can be possible to determine\\nposition by plotting an azimuth from two or more\\nnavigational facilities. If GPS is installed, or a pilot has\\na portable aviation GPS on board, it can be used to\\ndetermine the position and the location of the\\nnearest airport.\\nCommunicate with any available facility using\\nfrequencies shown on the sectional chart. If contact is\\nmade with a controller, radar vectors may be offered.\\nOther facilities may offer direction finding (DF)\\nassistance. To use this procedure, the controller will\\nrequest the pilot to hold down the transmit button for a\\nfew seconds and then release it. The controller may ask\\nthe pilot to change directions a few times and repeat the\\ntransmit procedure. This gives the controller enough\\ninformation to plot the airplane position and then give\\nvectors to a suitable landing site. If the situation\\nbecomes threatening, transmit the situation on the\\nemergency frequency 121.5 MHz and set the\\ntransponder to 7700. Most facilities, and even airliners,\\nmonitor the emergency frequency.\\nFLIGHT DIVERSION\\nThere will probably come a time when a pilot will not\\nbe able to make it to the planned destination. This can\\nbe the result of unpredicted weather conditions, a\\nsystem malfunction, or poor preflight planning. In any\\ncase, the pilot will need to be able to safely and\\nefficiently divert to an alternate destination. Before any\\ncross-country flight, check the charts for airports or\\nsuitable landing areas along or near the route of flight.\\nAlso, check for navigational aids that can be used\\nduring a diversion.\\nComputing course, time, speed, and distance\\ninformation in flight requires the same computations\\nused during preflight planning. However, because of\\nthe limited cockpit space, and because attention must\\nbe divided between flying the airplane, making\\ncalculations, and scanning for other airplanes, take\\nadvantage of all possible shortcuts and rule-of-thumb\\ncomputations.\\nWhen in flight, it is rarely practical to actually plot a\\ncourse on a sectional chart and mark checkpoints and\\ndistances. Furthermore, because an alternate airport is\\nusually not very far from your original course, actual\\nplotting is seldom necessary.\\nA course to an alternate can be measured accurately\\nwith a protractor or plotter, but can also be measured\\nwith reasonable accuracy using a straightedge and the\\ncompass rose depicted around VOR stations. This\\napproximation can be made on the basis of a radial\\nfrom a nearby VOR or an airway that closely parallels\\nthe course to your alternate. However, remember that\\nthe magnetic heading associated with a VOR radial or\\nprinted airway is outbound from the station. To find the\\ncourse TO the station, it may be necessary to determine\\nthe reciprocal of that heading. It is typically easier to\\nnavigate to an alternate airport that has a VOR or NDB\\nfacility on the field.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-27'),\n",

Sport pilots may hold either a\\nmedical certificate or a valid state driver’s license.\\nTo acquire a medical certificate, an examination by an\\naviation medical examiner (AME), a physician with\\ntraining in aviation medicine designated by the Civil\\nAerospace Medical Institute (CAMI), is required. There\\nare three classes of medical certificates. The class of\\ncertificate needed depends on the type of flying the pilot\\nplans to do.\\nA third-class medical is required for a private or\\nrecreational pilot certificate. It is valid for 3 years for\\nthose individuals who have not reached the age of 40;\\notherwise it is valid for 2 years. A commercial pilot\\ncertificate requires at least a second-class medical\\ncertificate, which is valid for 1 year. First-class med-\\nical certificates are required for airline transport\\npilots, and are valid for 6 months.\\nThe standards are more rigorous for the higher\\nclasses of certificates. A pilot with a higher class\\nmedical certificate has met the requirements for the\\nlower classes as well. Since the class of medical\\nrequired applies only when exercising the privileges\\nof the pilot certificate for which it is required, a first-\\nclass medical would be valid for 1 year if exercising\\nthe privileges of a commercial certificate, and 2 or 3\\nyears, as appropriate, for exercising the privileges of\\na private or recreational certificate. The same applies\\nfor a second-class medical certificate. The standards\\nfor medical certification are contained in Title 14 of\\nthe Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 67,\\nand the requirements for obtaining medical certifi-\\ncates are in 14 CFR part 61.\\nStudents who have physical limitations, such as impaired\\nvision, loss of a limb, or hearing impairment may be issued\\na medical certificate valid for “student pilot privileges\\nonly” while they are learning to fly. Pilots with disabilities\\nmay require special equipment installed in the airplane,\\nsuch as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia. Some\\ndisabilities necessitate a limitation on the individual’s\\ncertificate; for example, impaired hearing would require\\nthe limitation “not valid for flight requiring the use of\\nradio.” When all the knowledge, experience, and profi-\\nciency requirements have been met and a student can\\ndemonstrate the ability to operate the airplane with the\\nnormal level of safety, a “statement of demonstrated\\nability” (SODA) can be issued. This waiver or SODA is\\nvalid as long as their physical impairment does not worsen.\\nContact the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)\\nfor more information on this subject.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-1'),\n",

Some are minor, while others are\\nimportant enough to require special attention to ensure\\nsafety of flight. In some cases, physiological factors can\\nlead to in-flight emergencies. Some important medical\\nfactors that a pilot should be aware of include hypoxia,\\nhyperventilation, middle ear and sinus problems, spatial\\ndisorientation, motion sickness, carbon monoxide poi-\\nsoning, stress and fatigue, dehydration, and heatstroke.\\nOther subjects include the effects of alcohol and drugs,\\nanxiety, and excess nitrogen in the blood after scuba\\ndiving.\\nHYPOXIA\\nHypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough\\noxygen.” Although any tissue will die if deprived of\\noxygen long enough, usually the most concern is with\\ngetting enough oxygen to the brain, since it is particu-\\nlarly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation. Any reduction\\nin mental function while flying can result in life-\\nthreatening errors. Hypoxia can be caused by several\\nfactors including an insufficient supply of oxygen,\\ninadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of\\nthe body tissues to use oxygen. The forms of hypoxia\\nare divided into four major groups based on their\\ncauses: hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, stagnant\\nhypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\\nHYPOXIC HYPOXIA\\nHypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen avail-\\nable to the lungs. A blocked airway or drowning are\\nobvious examples of how the lungs can be deprived of\\noxygen, but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen\\nat high altitude is an appropriate example for pilots.\\nAlthough the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is\\nconstant, its partial pressure decreases proportionately\\nas atmospheric pressure decreases. As the airplane\\nascends during flight, the percentage of each gas in the\\natmosphere remains the same, but there are fewer mole-\\ncules available at the pressure required for them to pass\\nbetween the membranes in the respiratory system. This\\ndecrease of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressure can\\nlead to hypoxic hypoxia.\\nHYPEMIC HYPOXIA\\nThis occurs when the blood is not able to take up and\\ntransport a sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells in\\nthe body. Hypemic means “not enough blood.” This\\ntype of hypoxia is a result of oxygen deficiency in the\\nblood, rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen, and can be\\ncaused by a variety of factors. It may be because there\\nis not enough blood volume (due to severe bleeding),\\nor may result from certain blood diseases, such as ane-\\nmia. More often it is because hemoglobin, the actual\\nblood molecule that transports oxygen, is chemically\\nunable to bind oxygen molecules. The most common\\nform of hypemic hypoxia is carbon monoxide poison-\\ning. Hypemic hypoxia also can be caused by the loss of\\nblood from a blood donation. Blood can take several\\nweeks to return to normal following a donation.\\nAlthough the effects of the blood loss are slight at\\nground level, there are risks when flying during this\\ntime.\\nSTAGNANT HYPOXIA\\nStagnant means “not flowing,” and stagnant hypoxia\\nresults when the oxygen-rich blood in the lungs isn’t\\nmoving, for one reason or another, to the tissues that\\nneed it. An arm or leg going to sleep because the\\nblood flow has accidentally been shut off is one form\\nof stagnant hypoxia. This kind of hypoxia can also\\nresult from shock, the heart failing to pump blood\\neffectively, or a constricted artery. During flight,\\nstagnant hypoxia can occur when pulling excessive\\npositive Gs. Cold temperatures also can reduce circu-\\nlation and decrease the blood supplied to extremities.\\nHISTOTOXIC HYPOXIA\\nThe inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen is\\ndefined as histotoxic hypoxia. “Histo” refers to tissues\\nor cells, and “toxic” means poison. In this case, plenty\\nof oxygen is being transported to the cells that need it,\\nbut they are unable to make use of it. This impairment\\nof cellular respiration can be caused by alcohol and\\nother drugs, such as narcotics and poisons. Research\\nhas shown that drinking one ounce of alcohol can\\nequate to about an additional 2,000 feet of physiologi-\\ncal altitude.\\nSYMPTOMS OF HYPOXIA\\nHigh-altitude flying can place a pilot in danger of\\nbecoming hypoxic. Oxygen starvation causes the\\nbrain and other vital organs to become impaired. One\\nparticularly noteworthy attribute of the onset of\\nhypoxia is the fact that the first symptoms are eupho-\\nria and a carefree feeling. With increased oxygen\\nstarvation, the extremities become less responsive\\nand flying becomes less coordinated. The symptoms\\nof hypoxia vary with the individual, but common\\nsymptoms include:\\n• Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips)\\n• Headache\\n• Decreased reaction time\\n• Impaired judgment\\n• Euphoria\\n• Visual impairment\\n• Drowsiness\\n• Lightheaded or dizzy sensation\\n• Tingling in fingers and toes\\n• Numbness\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-2'),\n",

Even with all these symptoms, the effects\\nof hypoxia can cause a pilot to have a false sense of\\nsecurity and be deceived into believing that every-\\nthing is normal. The treatment for hypoxia includes\\nflying at lower altitudes and/or using supplemental\\noxygen.\\nAll pilots are susceptible to the effects of oxygen\\nstarvation, regardless of physical endurance or\\nacclimatization. When flying at high altitudes, it is\\nparamount that oxygen be used to avoid the effects\\nof hypoxia. The term “time of useful consciousness”\\ndescribes the maximum time the pilot has to make\\nrational, life-saving decisions and carry them out at\\na given altitude without supplemental oxygen.

If fly-\\ning at higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a\\npilot may have a tendency to breathe more rapidly than\\nnormal, which often leads to hyperventilation.\\nSince many of the symptoms of hyperventilation are\\nsimilar to those of hypoxia, it is important to correctly\\ndiagnose and treat the proper condition. If using sup-\\nplemental oxygen, check the equipment and flow rate\\nto ensure the symptoms are not hypoxia related.\\nCommon symptoms of hyperventilation include:\\n• Headache\\n• Decreased reaction time\\n• Impaired judgment\\n• Euphoria\\n• Visual impairment\\n• Drowsiness\\n• Lightheaded or dizzy sensation\\n• Tingling in fingers and toes\\n• Numbness\\n• Pale, clammy appearance\\n• Muscle spasms\\nHyperventilation may produce a pale, clammy\\nappearance and muscle spasms compared to the\\ncyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia.\\nThe treatment for hyperventilation involves restoring\\nthe proper carbon dioxide level in the body. Breathing\\nnormally is both the best prevention and the best cure\\nfor hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the\\nbreathing rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking\\naloud helps to overcome hyperventilation. Recovery\\nis usually rapid once the breathing rate is returned to\\nnormal.\\nMIDDLE EAR AND SINUS PROBLEMS\\nClimbs and descents can sometimes cause ear or sinus\\npain and a temporary reduction in the ability to hear.\\nThe physiological explanation for this discomfort is a\\ndifference between the pressure of the air outside the\\nAltitude Time of Useful\\nConsciousness\\n45,000 feet MSL\\n40,000 feet MSL\\n35,000 feet MSL\\n30,000 feet MSL\\n28,000 feet MSL\\n25,000 feet MSL\\n22,000 feet MSL\\n20,000 feet MSL\\n9 to 15 seconds\\n15 to 20 seconds\\n30 to 60 seconds\\n1 to 2 minutes\\n2 1/2 to 3 minutes\\n3 to 5 minutes\\n5 to 10 minutes\\n30 minutes or more\\nFigure 15-1.

It is closed off from the external ear canal by\\nthe eardrum. Normally, pressure differences between\\nthe middle ear and the outside world are equalized by a\\ntube leading from inside each ear to the back of the\\nthroat on each side, called the eustachian tube. These\\ntubes are usually closed, but open during chewing,\\nyawning, or swallowing to equalize pressure. Even a\\nslight difference between external pressure and middle\\near pressure can cause discomfort. [Figure 15-2]\\nDuring a climb, middle ear air pressure may exceed the\\npressure of the air in the external ear canal, causing the\\neardrum to bulge outward. Pilots become aware of this\\npressure change when they experience alternate sensa-\\ntions of “fullness” and “clearing.” During descent, the\\nreverse happens. While the pressure of the air in the\\nexternal ear canal increases, the middle ear cavity,\\nwhich equalized with the lower pressure at altitude, is\\nat lower pressure than the external ear canal. This\\nresults in the higher outside pressure, causing the\\neardrum to bulge inward.\\nThis condition can be more difficult to relieve due to\\nthe fact that the partial vacuum tends to constrict the\\nwalls of the eustachian tube. To remedy this often\\npainful condition, which also causes a temporary\\nreduction in hearing sensitivity, pinch the nostrils shut,\\nclose the mouth and lips, and blow slowly and gently in\\nthe mouth and nose.\\nThis procedure forces air through the eustachian tube\\ninto the middle ear. It may not be possible to equalize\\nthe pressure in the ears if a pilot has a cold, an ear infec-\\ntion, or sore throat. A flight in this condition can be\\nextremely painful, as well as damaging to the\\neardrums. If experiencing minor congestion, nose\\ndrops or nasal sprays may reduce the chance of a\\npainful ear blockage. Before using any medication,\\ncheck with an aviation medical examiner to ensure that\\nit will not affect the ability to fly.\\nIn a similar way, air pressure in the sinuses equalizes\\nwith the pressure in the cockpit through small openings\\nthat connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. An upper\\nrespiratory infection, such as a cold or sinusitis, or a\\nnasal allergic condition can produce enough congestion\\naround an opening to slow equalization. As the differ-\\nence in pressure between the sinus and the cockpit\\nincreases, congestion may plug the opening. This “sinus\\nblock” occurs most frequently during descent. Slow\\ndescent rates can reduce the associated pain. A sinus\\nblock can occur in the frontal sinuses, located above\\neach eyebrow, or in the maxillary sinuses, located in\\neach upper cheek. It will usually produce excruciating\\npain over the sinus area. A maxillary sinus block can\\nalso make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus may dis-\\ncharge from the nasal passages.\\nSinus block can be avoided by not flying with an upper\\nrespiratory infection or nasal allergic condition.\\nAdequate protection is usually not provided by decon-\\ngestant sprays or drops to reduce congestion around the\\nsinus openings. Oral decongestants have side effects\\nthat can impair pilot performance. If a sinus block does\\nnot clear shortly after landing, a physician should be\\nconsulted.\\nSPATIAL DISORIENTATION AND ILLUSIONS\\nSpatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of\\norientation with regard to the position, attitude, or\\nmovement of the airplane in space. The body uses\\nthree integrated systems working together to ascertain\\norientation and movement in space. The eye is by far\\nthe largest source of information. Kinesthesia refers to\\nthe sensation of position, movement, and tension per-\\nceived through the nerves, muscles, and tendons. The\\nvestibular system is a very sensitive motion sensing\\nsystem located in the inner ears. It reports head posi-\\ntion, orientation, and movement in three-dimensional\\nspace.\\nAll this information comes together in the brain, and\\nmost of the time, the three streams of information agree,\\ngiving a clear idea of where and how the body is mov-\\ning. Flying can sometimes cause these systems to supply\\nconflicting information to the brain, which can lead to\\ndisorientation. During flight in visual meteorological\\nconditions (VMC), the eyes are the major orientation\\nsource and usually prevail over false sensations from\\nother sensory systems. When these visual cues are taken\\naway, as they are in instrument meteorological condi-\\ntions (IMC), false sensations can cause a pilot to quickly\\nbecome disoriented.\\nThe vestibular system in the inner ear allows the\\npilot to sense movement and determine orientation\\nMIDDLE EAR\\nOpening\\nto ThroatEustachian\\nTube\\nAuditory\\nCanal\\nOUTER EAR\\nEardrum\\nFigure 15-2.The eustachian tube allows air pressure to equal-\\nize in the middle ear.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-4'),\n",

In both the left and\\nright inner ear, three semicircular canals are posi-\\ntioned at approximate right angles to each other.\\nEach canal is filled with fluid and has a section full\\nof fine hairs. Acceleration of the inner ear in any\\ndirection causes the tiny hairs to deflect, which in\\nturn stimulates nerve impulses, sending messages to\\nthe brain. The vestibular nerve transmits the\\nimpulses from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular\\ncanals to the brain to interpret motion. [Figure 15-3]\\nThe postural system sends signals from the skin,\\njoints, and muscles to the brain that are interpreted in\\nrelation to the earth’s gravitational pull. These signals\\ndetermine posture. Inputs from each movement\\nupdate the body’s position to the brain on a constant\\nbasis. “Seat of the pants” flying is largely dependent\\nupon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual\\nand vestibular clues, these sensations can be fairly\\nreliable. However, the body cannot distinguish\\nbetween acceleration forces due to gravity and those\\nresulting from maneuvering the aircraft, which can\\nlead to sensory illusions and false impressions of the\\nairplane’s orientation and movement.\\nUnder normal flight conditions, when there is a\\nvisual reference to the horizon and ground, the sen-\\nsory system in the inner ear helps to identify the\\npitch, roll, and yaw movements of the airplane. When\\nvisual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular\\nsystem becomes unreliable. Without visual refer-\\nences outside the airplane, there are many situations\\nwhere combinations of normal motions and forces\\ncan create convincing illusions that are difficult to\\novercome. In a classic example, a pilot may believe\\nthe airplane is in level flight, when, in reality, it is in\\na gradual turn. If the airspeed increases, the pilot may\\nexperience a postural sensation of a level dive and\\npull back on the stick, which tightens the turn and\\ncreates increasing G-loads. If recovery is not initi-\\nated, a steep spiral will develop. This is sometimes\\ncalled the graveyard spiral, because if the pilot fails\\nto recognize that the airplane is in a spiral and fails to\\nreturn the airplane to wings-level flight, the airplane\\nwill eventually strike the ground. If the horizon\\nbecomes visible again, the pilot will have an oppor-\\ntunity to return the airplane to straight-and-level\\nflight, and continued visual contact with the horizon\\nwill allow the pilot to maintain straight-and-level\\nflight. However, if contact with the horizon is lost\\nagain, the inner ear may fool the pilot into thinking\\nthe airplane has started a bank in the other direction,\\ncausing the graveyard spiral to begin all over again.\\nPrevention is usually the best remedy for spatial disori-\\nentation. Unless a pilot has many hours of training in\\ninstrument flight, flight in reduced visibility or at night\\nwhen the horizon is not visible should be avoided. A\\npilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions\\nthrough training and awareness, and learning to rely\\ntotally on flight instruments.\\nBesides the sensory illusions due to misleading inputs\\nto the vestibular system, a pilot may also encounter var-\\nious visual illusions during flight. Illusions rank among\\nthe most common factors cited as contributing to fatal\\nairplane accidents.\\nSloping cloud formations, an obscured horizon, a dark\\nscene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain\\ngeometric patterns of ground light can create illusions\\nof not being aligned correctly with the actual horizon.\\nVarious surface features and atmospheric conditions\\nencountered in landing can create illusions of being\\non the wrong approach path.

[Figure 15-4]\\nA runway that slopes up, or upsloping terrain, can cre-\\nate the illusion that the airplane is at a higher altitude\\nthan it actually is, and downsloping runways or terrain\\ncan create the opposite effect.

Seeing the sun through a slow-\\nmoving propeller can produce the effect of a flashing\\nlight. So can bright light reflecting off the back of the\\npropeller. Symptoms are rare, but be aware of the\\npossibility.\\nMOTION SICKNESS\\nMotion sickness, or airsickness, is caused by the brain\\nreceiving conflicting messages about the state of the\\nbody. A pilot may experience motion sickness during\\ninitial flights, but it generally goes away within the\\nfirst few lessons. Anxiety and stress, which may be\\nexperienced at the beginning of flight training, can\\ncontribute to motion sickness. Symptoms of motion\\nsickness include general discomfort, nausea, dizzi-\\nness, paleness, sweating, and vomiting.\\nIt is important to remember that experiencing airsick-\\nness is no reflection on one’s ability as a pilot. If\\nprone to motion sickness, let the flight instructor\\nknow since there are techniques that can be used to\\novercome this problem. For example, avoid lessons in\\nturbulent conditions until becoming more comfortable\\nin the airplane, or start with shorter flights and gradu-\\nate to longer instruction periods. If symptoms of\\nmotion sickness are experienced during a lesson,\\nopening fresh air vents, focusing on objects outside\\nthe airplane, and avoiding unnecessary head move-\\nments may help alleviate some of the discomfort.\\nAlthough medications like Dramamine can prevent\\nairsickness in passengers, they are not recommended\\nwhile flying since they can cause drowsiness and\\nother problems.\\nCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas\\nproduced by all internal combustion engines. Since it\\nattaches itself to the hemoglobin in the blood about 200\\ntimes more easily than oxygen, carbon monoxide pre-\\nvents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells,\\nresulting in hypemic hypoxia. It can take up to 48 hours\\nfor the body to dispose of carbon monoxide. If the poi-\\nsoning is severe enough, it can result in death. Aircraft\\nheater vents and defrost vents may provide carbon\\nmonoxide a passageway into the cabin, particularly if\\nthe engine exhaust system has a leak or is damaged. If a\\nstrong odor of exhaust gases is detected, assume that car-\\nbon monoxide is present. However, carbon monoxide\\nmay be present in dangerous amounts even if no exhaust\\nodor is detected. Disposable, inexpensive carbon\\nmonoxide detectors are widely available. In the presence\\nof carbon monoxide, these detectors change color to alert\\nthe pilot of the presence of carbon monoxide. Some\\neffects of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache,\\nblurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, and/or loss of\\nmuscle power. Anytime a pilot smells exhaust odor, or\\nany time that these symptoms are experienced, immedi-\\nate corrective actions should be taken. These include\\nturning off the heater, opening fresh air vents and win-\\ndows, and using supplemental oxygen, if available.\\nTobacco smoke also causes carbon monoxide poisoning.\\nSmoking at sea level can raise the CO concentration in\\nthe blood and result in physiological effects similar to\\nflying at 8,000 feet. Besides hypoxia, tobacco causes dis-\\neases and physiological debilitation that are medically\\ndisqualifying for pilots.\\nSTRESS\\nStress is defined as the body’s response to physical and\\npsychological demands placed upon it. The body’s\\nreaction to stress includes releasing chemical hormones\\n(such as adrenaline) into the blood, and increasing\\nmetabolism to provide more energy to the muscles. The\\nblood sugar, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and\\nperspiration all increase. The term “stressor” is used to\\ndescribe an element that causes an individual to experi-\\nence stress. Examples of stressors include physical\\nstress (noise or vibration), physiological stress\\n(fatigue), and psychological stress (difficult work or\\npersonal situations).\\nStress falls into two broad categories, including acute\\nstress (short term) and chronic stress (long term).

This is the type of stress that triggers a “fight or\\nflight” response in an individual, whether the threat is\\nreal or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can cope\\nwith acute stress and prevent stress overload. However,\\non-going acute stress can develop into chronic stress.\\nChronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that\\npresents an intolerable burden, exceeds the ability of an\\nindividual to cope, and causes individual performance\\nto fall sharply. Unrelenting psychological pressures,\\nsuch as loneliness, financial worries, and relationship\\nor work problems can produce a cumulative level of\\nstress that exceeds a person’s ability to cope with the\\nsituation. When stress reaches these levels, perform-\\nance falls off rapidly. Pilots experiencing this level of\\nstress are not safe and should not exercise their airman\\nprivileges. Pilots who suspect they are suffering from\\nchronic stress should consult a physician.\\nFATIGUE\\nFatigue is frequently associated with pilot error.\\nSome of the effects of fatigue include degradation of\\nattention and concentration, impaired coordination,\\nand decreased ability to communicate. These factors\\ncan seriously influence the ability to make effective\\ndecisions. Physical fatigue can result from sleep loss,\\nexercise, or physical work. Factors such as stress and\\nprolonged performance of cognitive work can result\\nin mental fatigue.\\nLike stress, fatigue also falls into two broad categories:\\nacute and chronic. Acute fatigue is short term and is a\\nnormal occurrence in everyday living. It is the kind of\\ntiredness people feel after a period of strenuous effort,\\nexcitement, or lack of sleep. Rest after exertion and 8\\nhours of sound sleep ordinarily cures this condition.\\nA special type of acute fatigue is skill fatigue. This type\\nof fatigue has two main effects on performance:\\n• Timing disruption \\uf8e7Appearing to perform a\\ntask as usual, but the timing of each component is\\nslightly off. This makes the pattern of the opera-\\ntion less smooth, because the pilot performs each\\ncomponent as though it were separate, instead of\\npart of an integrated activity.\\n• Disruption of the perceptual field \\uf8e7\\nConcentrating attention upon movements or\\nobjects in the center of vision and neglecting\\nthose in the periphery. This may be accompanied\\nby loss of accuracy and smoothness in control\\nmovements.\\nAcute fatigue has many causes, but the following are\\namong the most important for the pilot:\\n• Mild hypoxia (oxygen deficiency)\\n• Physical stress\\n• Psychological stress\\n• Depletion of physical energy resulting from psy-\\nchological stress\\nSustained psychological stress accelerates the glandular\\nsecretions that prepare the body for quick reactions dur-\\ning an emergency. These secretions make the circulatory\\nand respiratory systems work harder, and the liver\\nreleases energy to provide the extra fuel needed for brain\\nand muscle work. When this reserve energy supply is\\ndepleted, the body lapses into generalized and severe\\nfatigue.\\nAcute fatigue can be prevented by a proper diet and\\nadequate rest and sleep. A well-balanced diet prevents\\nthe body from having to consume its own tissues as an\\nenergy source. Adequate rest maintains the body’s store\\nof vital energy.\\nChronic fatigue, extending over a long period of time,\\nusually has psychological roots, although an underlying\\ndisease is sometimes responsible. Continuous high stress\\nlevels, for example, can produce chronic fatigue. Chronic\\nfatigue is not relieved by proper diet and adequate rest\\nand sleep, and usually requires treatment by a physician.\\nAn individual may experience this condition in the form\\nof weakness, tiredness, palpitations of the heart, breath-\\nlessness, headaches, or irritability. Sometimes chronic\\nfatigue even creates stomach or intestinal problems and\\ngeneralized aches and pains throughout the body. When\\nthe condition becomes serious enough, it can lead to\\nemotional illness.\\nIf suffering from acute fatigue, stay on the ground. If\\nfatigue occurs in the cockpit, no amount of training or\\nexperience can overcome the detrimental effects.\\nGetting adequate rest is the only way to prevent\\nfatigue from occurring. Avoid flying without a full\\nnight’s rest, after working excessive hours, or after an\\nespecially exhausting or stressful day. Pilots who sus-\\npect they are suffering from chronic fatigue should\\nconsult a physician.\\nDEHYDRATION AND HEATSTROKE\\nDehydration is the term given to a critical loss of\\nwater from the body. The first noticeable effect of\\ndehydration is fatigue, which in turn makes top\\nphysical and mental performance difficult, if not\\nimpossible. As a pilot, flying for long periods in hot\\nsummer temperatures or at high altitudes increases\\nthe susceptibility of dehydration since the dry air at\\naltitude tends to increase the rate of water loss from\\nthe body. If this fluid is not replaced, fatigue pro-\\ngresses to dizziness, weakness, nausea, tingling of\\nhands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extreme\\nthirst.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-7'),\n",

Onset of this condition\\nmay be recognized by the symptoms of dehydration,\\nbut also has been known to be recognized only by\\ncomplete collapse.\\nTo prevent these symptoms, it is recommended that an\\nample supply of water be carried and used at frequent\\nintervals on any long flight, whether thirsty or not. If\\nthe airplane has a canopy or roof window, wearing\\nlight-colored, porous clothing and a hat will help pro-\\nvide protection from the sun. Keeping the cockpit well\\nventilated aids in dissipating excess heat.\\nALCOHOL\\nAlcohol impairs the efficiency of the human mecha-\\nnism. Studies have positively proven that drinking\\nand performance deterioration are closely linked.\\nPilots must make hundreds of decisions, some of them\\ntime-critical, during the course of a flight. The safe\\noutcome of any flight depends on the ability to make\\nthe correct decisions and take the appropriate actions\\nduring routine occurrences, as well as abnormal situa-\\ntions. The influence of alcohol drastically reduces the\\nchances of completing a flight without incident. Even\\nin small amounts, alcohol can impair judgment,\\ndecrease sense of responsibility, affect coordination,\\nconstrict visual field, diminish memory, reduce rea-\\nsoning power, and lower attention span. As little as\\none ounce of alcohol can decrease the speed and\\nstrength of muscular reflexes, lessen the efficiency of\\neye movements while reading, and increase the fre-\\nquency at which errors are committed. Impairments\\nin vision and hearing occur at alcohol blood levels as\\nlow as .01 percent.\\nThe alcohol consumed in beer and mixed drinks is\\nethyl alcohol, a central nervous system depressant.\\nFrom a medical point of view, it acts on the body much\\nlike a general anesthetic. The “dose” is generally much\\nlower and more slowly consumed in the case of alco-\\nhol, but the basic effects on the system are similar.\\nAlcohol is easily and quickly absorbed by the digestive\\ntract. The bloodstream absorbs about 80 to 90 percent\\nof the alcohol in a drink within 30 minutes on an empty\\nstomach. The body requires about 3 hours to rid itself\\nof all the alcohol contained in one mixed drink or one\\nbeer.\\nWith a hangover, a pilot is still under the influence of\\nalcohol. Although a pilot may think that he or she is\\nfunctioning normally, the impairment of motor and\\nmental responses still remains. Considerable amounts\\nof alcohol can remain in the body for over 16 hours, so\\npilots should be cautious about flying too soon after\\ndrinking.\\nAltitude multiplies the effects of alcohol on the brain.\\nWhen combined with altitude, the alcohol from two\\ndrinks may have the same effect as three or four drinks.\\nAlcohol interferes with the brain’s ability to utilize\\noxygen, producing a form of histotoxic hypoxia. The\\neffects are rapid because alcohol passes so quickly into\\nthe bloodstream. In addition, the brain is a highly vas-\\ncular organ that is immediately sensitive to changes in\\nthe blood’s composition. For a pilot, the lower oxygen\\navailability at altitude, along with the lower capability\\nof the brain to use what oxygen is there, adds up to a\\ndeadly combination.\\nIntoxication is determined by the amount of alcohol in\\nthe bloodstream. This is usually measured as a percent-\\nage by weight in the blood. 14 CFR part 91 requires\\nthat blood alcohol level be less than .04 percent and\\nthat 8 hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting\\nan airplane. A pilot with a blood alcohol level of .04\\npercent or greater after 8 hours cannot fly until the\\nblood alcohol falls below that amount. Even though\\nblood alcohol may be well below .04 percent, a pilot\\ncannot fly sooner than 8 hours after drinking alcohol.\\nAlthough the regulations are quite specific, it is a good\\nidea to be more conservative than the regulations.\\nDRUGS\\nPilot performance can be seriously degraded by both\\nprescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well\\nas by the medical conditions for which they are taken.\\nMany medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives,\\nstrong pain relievers, and cough-suppressants have\\nprimary effects that may impair judgment, memory,\\nalertness, coordination, vision, and the ability to make\\ncalculations. Others, such as antihistamines, blood\\npressure drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to con-\\ntrol diarrhea and motion sickness have side effects\\nthat may impair the same critical functions. Any med-\\nication that depresses the nervous system, such as a\\nsedative, tranquilizer, or antihistamine can make a\\npilot more susceptible to hypoxia.\\nPain-killers can be grouped into two broad categories:\\nanalgesics and anesthetics. Analgesics are drugs that\\nreduce pain, while anesthetics are drugs that deaden\\npain or cause loss of consciousness.\\nOver-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic\\nacid (Aspirin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ibupro-\\nfen (Advil) have few side effects when taken in the\\ncorrect dosage. Although some people are allergic to\\ncertain analgesics or may suffer from stomach irrita-\\ntion, flying usually is not restricted when taking these\\ndrugs. However, flying is almost always precluded\\nwhile using prescription analgesics, such as Darvon,\\nPercodan, Demerol, and codeine since these drugs\\nmay cause side effects such as mental confusion,\\ndizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-8'),\n",

The most\\ncommon depressant is alcohol.\\nSome drugs, which can neither be classified as stimu-\\nlants nor depressants, have adverse effects on flying.\\nFor example, some forms of antibiotics can produce\\ndangerous side effects, such as balance disorders,\\nhearing loss, nausea, and vomiting. While many\\nantibiotics are safe for use while flying, the infection\\nrequiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying. In addi-\\ntion, unless specifically prescribed by a physician, do\\nnot take more than one drug at a time, and never mix\\ndrugs with alcohol, because the effects are often\\nunpredictable.\\nThe dangers of illegal drugs also are well documented.\\nCertain illegal drugs can have hallucinatory effects that\\noccur days or weeks after the drug is taken. Obviously,\\nthese drugs have no place in the aviation community.\\nThe Code of Federal Regulations prohibits pilots from\\nperforming crewmember duties while using any med-\\nication that affects the faculties in any way contrary to\\nsafety. The safest rule is not to fly as a crewmember\\nwhile taking any medication, unless approved to do so\\nby the FAA. If there is any doubt regarding the effects\\nof any medication, consult an aviation medical exam-\\niner before flying.\\nSCUBA DIVING\\nScuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure,\\nwhich allows more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues\\nand fluids. The reduction of atmospheric pressure that\\naccompanies flying can produce physical problems for\\nscuba divers. Reducing the pressure too quickly allows\\nsmall bubbles of nitrogen to form inside the body as\\nthe gas comes out of solution. These bubbles can cause\\na painful and potentially incapacitating condition\\ncalled “the bends.” (An example is dissolved gas form-\\ning bubbles as pressure decreases by slowly opening a\\ntransparent bottle of soda.) Scuba training emphasizes\\nhow to prevent the bends when rising to the surface,\\nbut increased nitrogen concentrations can remain in tis-\\nsue fluids for several hours after a diver leaves the\\nwater. The bends can be experienced from as low as\\n8,000 feet MSL, with increasing severity as altitude\\nincreases. As noted in the Aeronautical Information\\nManual (AIM), the minimum recommended time\\nbetween scuba diving on nondecompression stop dives\\nand flying is 12 hours, while the minimum time recom-\\nmended between decompression stop diving and flying\\nis 24 hours. [Figure 15-5]\\nVISION IN FLIGHT\\nOf all the senses, vision is the most important for safe\\nflight. Most of the things perceived while flying are\\nvisual or heavily supplemented by vision. As remarkable\\nand vital as it is, vision is subject to some limitations,\\nsuch as illusions and blind spots. The more a pilot under-\\nstands about the eyes and how they function, the easier it\\nis to use vision effectively and compensate for potential\\nproblems.\\nThe eye functions much like a camera. Its structure\\nincludes an aperture, a lens, a mechanism for focusing,\\nand a surface for registering images. Light enters\\nFigure 15-5.

The retina con-\\ntains light sensitive cells that convert light energy into\\nelectrical impulses that travel through nerves to the\\nbrain. The brain interprets the electrical signals to form\\nimages. There are two kinds of light sensitive cells in\\nthe eyes: rods and cones. [Figure 15-6]\\nThe cones are responsible for all color vision, from\\nappreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle\\nshades in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout\\nthe retina, but are concentrated toward the center of the\\nfield of vision at the back of the retina. There is a small\\npit called the fovea where almost all the light sensing\\ncells are cones. This is the area where most “looking”\\noccurs (the center of the visual field where detail, color\\nsensitivity, and resolution are highest).\\nWhile the cones and their associated nerves are well\\nsuited to detecting fine detail and color in high light\\nlevels, the rods are better able to detect movement and\\nprovide vision in dim light. The rods are unable to dis-\\ncern color but are very sensitive in low light levels.\\nThe trouble with rods is that a large amount of light\\noverwhelms them, and they take a long time to “reset”\\nand adapt to the dark again. There are so many cones\\nin the fovea that the very center of the visual field\\nhardly has any rods at all. So in low light, the middle\\nof the visual field isn’t very sensitive, but farther from\\nthe fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide\\nthe major portion of night vision. \\nThe area where the optic nerve enters the eyeball has\\nno rods or cones, leaving a blind spot in the field of\\nvision. Normally, each eye compensates for the other’s\\nblind spot. Figure 15-7 provides a dramatic example of\\nthe eye’s blind spot. Cover the right eye and hold this\\npage at arm’s length.

With nothing to focus on, the eyes automatically\\nfocus on a point just slightly ahead of the airplane.\\nSearching out and focusing on distant light sources, no\\nmatter how dim, helps prevent the onset of empty-field\\nmyopia.\\nNIGHT VISION\\nIt is estimated that once fully adapted to darkness, the\\nrods are 10,000 times more sensitive to light than the\\ncones, making them the primary receptors for night\\nvision. Since the cones are concentrated near the fovea,\\nthe rods are also responsible for much of the peripheral\\nvision. The concentration of cones in the fovea can make\\na night blind spot in the center of the field of vision. To\\nsee an object clearly at night, the pilot must expose the\\nrods to the image. This can be done by looking 5°to 10°\\noff center of the object to be seen.

When looking directly at\\nthe light, it dims or disappears altogether. When looking\\nslightly off center, it becomes clearer and brighter. \\nRefer to figure 15-8. When looking directly at an\\nobject, the image is focused mainly on the fovea, where\\ndetail is best seen. At night, the ability to see an object\\nin the center of the visual field is reduced as the cones\\nlose much of their visual acuity and the rods become\\nmore sensitive. Looking off center can help compen-\\nsate for this night blind spot. Along with the loss of\\nsharpness and color at night, depth perception and\\njudgment of size may be lost.\\nWhile the cones adapt rapidly to changes in light inten-\\nsities, the rods take much longer. Walking from bright\\nsunlight into a dark movie theater is an example of this\\ndark adaptation period experience. The rods can take\\napproximately 30 minutes to fully adapt to the dark. A\\nbright light, however, can completely destroy night\\nadaptation, leaving night vision severely compromised\\nwhile the adaptation process is repeated.\\nSeveral things can be done to keep the eyes adapted to\\nthe dark. The first is obvious: avoid bright lights before\\nand during the flight. For 30 minutes before a night\\nflight, avoid any bright light sources, such as head-\\nlights, landing lights, strobe lights, or flashlights. If a\\nbright light is encountered, close one eye to keep it\\nlight sensitive. This allows the use of that eye to see\\nagain once the light is gone.\\nRed cockpit lighting also helps preserve night vision, but\\nred light severely distorts some colors and completely\\nwashes out the color red. This makes reading an aero-\\nnautical chart difficult. A dim white light or a carefully\\ndirected flashlight can enhance night reading ability.\\nWhile flying at night, keep the instrument panel and inte-\\nrior lights turned up no higher than necessary.

Deficiencies in\\nvitamins A and C have been shown to reduce night acu-\\nity. Other factors, such as carbon monoxide poisoning,\\nsmoking, alcohol, certain drugs, and a lack of oxygen\\nalso can greatly decrease night vision.\\nNIGHT VISUAL ILLUSIONS\\nThere are many different types of visual illusions that\\ncommonly occur at night. Anticipating and staying\\naware of them is usually the best way to avoid them.\\nAUTOKINESIS\\nAutokinesis is caused by staring at a single point of light\\nagainst a dark background for more than a few seconds.\\nAfter a few moments, the light appears to move on its\\nown. To prevent this illusion, focus the eyes on objects at\\nvarying distances and avoid fixating on one target.

It can be generated by\\nconfusing bright stars and city lights. It can also occur\\nwhile flying toward the shore of an ocean or a large\\nlake. Because of the relative darkness of the water, the\\nlights along the shoreline can be mistaken for stars in\\nthe sky. [Figure 15-9]\\nCones Active\\nRods Active Night Blind Spot\\nFigure 15-8.

The impor-\\ntance of learning effective ADM skills cannot be\\noveremphasized. While progress is continually being\\nmade in the advancement of pilot training methods, air-\\nplane equipment and systems, and services for pilots,\\naccidents still occur. Despite all the changes in technol-\\nogy to improve flight safety, one factor remains the\\nsame\\uf8e7the human factor. It is estimated that approxi-\\nmately 75 percent of all aviation accidents are human\\nfactors related.\\nHistorically, the term “pilot error” has been used to\\ndescribe the causes of these accidents. Pilot error\\nmeans that an action or decision made by the pilot was\\nthe cause, or a contributing factor that led to the acci-\\ndent. This definition also includes the pilot’s failure to\\nmake a decision or take action. From a broader per-\\nspective, the phrase “human factors related” more aptly\\ndescribes these accidents since it is usually not a single\\ndecision that leads to an accident, but a chain of events\\ntriggered by a number of factors.\\nThe poor judgment chain, sometimes referred to as the\\n“error chain,” is a term used to describe this concept of\\ncontributing factors in a human factors-related acci-\\ndent. Breaking one link in the chain normally is all that\\nis necessary to change the outcome of the sequence of\\nevents. The following is an example illustrating the\\npoor judgment chain.\\nA private pilot with around 350 hours was ferrying an\\nairplane cross-country to a new owner. Due to time\\nconstraints, the pilot skipped dinner the night before\\nand had no breakfast on the morning of the flight. The\\npilot planned to have lunch around noon at a fuel stop.\\nA descent was begun from 9,500 feet, about 20 miles\\nfrom the chosen fuel stop, due to haze and unfamiliarity\\nwith the area. When the airplane arrived at pattern alti-\\ntude, the pilot could not find the airport. The pilot then\\ncircled north of the town, then back over the town, then\\nflew to the west, then turned back to the east.\\nThe pilot decided to check for airport information in\\nthe Airport/Facility Directory, which was on the rear\\nseat and not readily available.\\nPower had not been increased since the descent to\\npattern altitude, and the pilot had been holding back\\npressure on the yoke. While attempting to retrieve the\\nAirport/Facility Directory, a loud “bang” was heard.\\nLooking up, the pilot discovered the airplane was only\\nabout 200 feet above ground level.

For\\nexample, one of the first elements that affected the\\npilot’s flight was fatigue. The pilot understood that\\nfatigue and hunger could affect the ability to fly\\nsafely, but let the desire to stay on schedule override\\nthe concern for a safe flight.\\nNext, the rush to get airborne led the pilot to skip or\\npostpone necessary aspects of preflight planning.\\nResearch before takeoff, with a quick review before\\ndescent, could have ensured a clear mental picture of\\nthe location of the airport in relation to the town.\\nCopying relevant information from flight guides and\\nother information sources is part of careful preflight\\nplanning.

Making\\nsound decisions is the key to preventing accidents.\\nTraditional pilot training has emphasized flying skills,\\nknowledge of the airplane, and familiarity with regula-\\ntions. ADM training focuses on the decision-making\\nprocess and the factors that affect a pilot’s ability to\\nmake effective choices.\\nORIGINS OF ADM TRAINING\\nThe airlines developed some of the first training\\nprograms that focused on improving aeronautical\\ndecision making. Human factors-related accidents\\nmotivated the airline industry to implement crew\\nresource management (CRM) training for flight\\ncrews. The focus of CRM programs is the effective\\nuse of all available resources; human resources,\\nhardware, and information. Human resources\\ninclude all groups routinely working with the cock-\\npit crew (or pilot) who are involved in decisions\\nthat are required to operate a flight safely. These\\ngroups include, but are not limited to: dispatchers,\\ncabin crewmembers, maintenance personnel, and\\nair traffic controllers. Although the CRM concept\\noriginated as airlines developed ways of facilitating\\ncrew cooperation to improve decision making in the\\ncockpit, CRM principles, such as workload manage-\\nment, situational awareness, communication, the\\nleadership role of the captain, and crewmember\\ncoordination have direct application to the general\\naviation cockpit. This also includes single pilot\\noperations since pilots of small airplanes, as well as\\ncrews of larger airplanes, must make effective use\\nof all available resources—human resources, hard-\\nware, and information. AC 60-22, Aeronautical\\nDecision Making , provides background references,\\ndefinitions, and other pertinent information about\\nADM training in the general aviation environment.\\n[Figure 16-1]\\nTHE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS\\nAn understanding of the decision-making process\\nprovides a pilot with a foundation for developing\\nADM skills. Some situations, such as engine fail-\\nures, require a pilot to respond immediately using\\nestablished procedures with little time for detailed\\nanalysis. Traditionally, pilots have been well trained\\nto react to emergencies, but are not as well prepared\\nto make decisions requiring a more reflective\\nresponse. Typically during a flight, there is time to\\nexamine any changes that occur, gather information,\\nand assess risk before reaching a decision. The steps\\nleading to this conclusion constitute the decision-\\nmaking process. \\nDEFINING THE PROBLEM\\nProblem definition is the first step in the decision-\\nmaking process. Defining the problem begins with\\nrecognizing that a change has occurred or that an\\nexpected change did not occur. A problem is perceived\\nfirst by the senses, then is distinguished through\\ninsight and experience. These same abilities, as well as\\nan objective analysis of all available information, are\\nused to determine the exact nature and severity of the\\nproblem.\\nOne critical error that can be made during the deci-\\nsion-making process is incorrectly defining the\\nproblem. For example, a low oil pressure reading\\ncould indicate that the engine is about to fail and an\\nemergency landing should be planned, or it could\\nmean that the oil pressure sensor has failed. The\\nactions to be taken in each of these circumstances\\nwould be significantly different. Fixating on a\\nproblem that does not exist can divert attention\\nfrom important tasks. The pilot’s failure to main-\\ntain an awareness of the circumstances regarding\\nthe flight now becomes the problem. This is why\\nonce an initial assumption is made regarding the\\nproblem, other sources must be used to verify that\\nthe conclusion is correct.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-2'),\n",

By noticing this discrepancy,\\nchange has been recognized. Based on insight, cross-\\ncountry flying experience, and knowledge of airplane\\nsystems, the pilot considers the possibility that there\\nmight be enough fuel to reach the destination. Factors\\nthat may increase the fuel burn rate could include\\nenvironmental factors, such as higher-than-expected\\nheadwinds and lower-than-expected groundspeed. To\\ndetermine the severity of the problem, recalculate the\\nfuel consumption and reassess fuel requirements .\\nCHOOSING A COURSE OF ACTION\\nAfter the problem has been identified, the pilot must\\nevaluate the need to react to it and determine the\\nactions that may be taken to resolve the situation in the\\ntime available. The expected outcome of each possible\\naction should be considered and the risks assessed\\nbefore deciding on a response to the situation.\\nThe pilot determines there is insufficient fuel to reach\\nthe destination, and considers other options, such as\\nturning around and landing at a nearby airport that\\nhas been passed, diverting off course, or landing prior\\nto the destination at an airport on the route. The\\nexpected outcome of each possible action must be\\nconsidered along with an assessment of the risks\\ninvolved. After studying the aeronautical chart, the\\npilot concludes that there is an airport that has fuel-\\ning services within the remaining fuel range along the\\nroute. The time expended for the extra fuel stop is a\\nworthwhile investment to ensure a safe completion of\\nthe flight.\\nDEFINITIONS\\nAERONAUTICAL DECISION MAKING (ADM) is a systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently \\ndetermine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances.\\nATTITUDE is a personal motivational predisposition to respond to persons, situations, or events in a given manner that can, \\nnevertheless, be changed or modified through training as sort of a mental shortcut to decision making.\\nATTITUDE MANAGEMENT is the ability to recognize hazardous attitudes in oneself and the willingness to modify them as \\nnecessary through the application of an appropriate antidote thought.\\nHEADWORK is required to accomplish a conscious, rational thought process when making decisions. Good decision making \\ninvolves risk identification and assessment, information processing, and problem solving.\\nJUDGMENT is the mental process of recognizing and analyzing all pertinent information in a particular situation, a rational \\nevaluation of alternative actions in response to it, and a timely decision on which action to take.\\nPERSONALITY is the embodiment of personal traits and characteristics of an individual that are set at a very early age and \\nextremely resistant to change.\\nPOOR JUDGMENT CHAIN is a series of mistakes that may lead to an accident or incident. Two basic principles generally \\nassociated with the creation of a poor judgment chain are: (1) One bad decision often leads to another; and (2) as a string of bad\\ndecisions grows, it reduces the number of subsequent alternatives for continued safe flight. ADM is intended to break the poor \\njudgment chain before it can cause an accident or incident.\\nRISK ELEMENTS IN ADM take into consideration the four fundamental risk elements: the pilot, the aircraft, the environment, and \\nthe type of operation that comprise any given aviation situation.\\nRISK MANAGEMENT is the part of the decision making process which relies on situational awareness, problem recognition, and \\ngood judgment to reduce risks associated with each flight.\\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS is the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four \\nfundamental risk elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight.\\nSKILLS and PROCEDURES are the procedural, psychomotor, and perceptual skills used to control a specific aircraft or its \\nsystems. They are the airmanship abilities that are gained through conventional training, are perfected, and become almost \\nautomatic through experience.\\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT is the personal analysis of the kinds of stress experienced while flying, the application of appropriate \\nstress assessment tools, and other coping mechanisms.\\nCREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CRM) is the application of team management concepts in the flight deck environment. It \\nwas initially known as cockpit resource management, but as CRM programs evolved to include cabin crews, maintenance \\npersonnel, and others, the phrase crew resource management was adopted. This includes single pilots, as in most general \\naviation aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft, as well as crews of larger aircraft, must make effective use of all available resources; \\nhuman resources, hardware, and information. A current definition includes all groups routinely working with the cockpit crew who\\nare involved in decisions required to operate a flight safely. These groups include, but are not limited to: pilots, dispatchers, cabin\\ncrewmembers, maintenance personnel, and air traffic controllers. CRM is one way of addressing the challenge of optimizing the \\nhuman/machine interface and accompanying interpersonal activities.\\nFigure 16-1.

To help\\nremember the elements of the decision-making\\nprocess, a six-step model has been developed using the\\nacronym “DECIDE.” [Figure 16-2]\\nRISK MANAGEMENT\\nDuring each flight, decisions must be made regarding\\nevents involving interactions between the four risk\\nelements —the pilot in command, the airplane, the\\nenvironment, and the operation. The decision-making\\nprocess involves an evaluation of each of these risk\\nelements to achieve an accurate perception of the\\nflight situation.

Below is a review of the four risk elements and\\nhow they affect decision making regarding the follow-\\ning situations.\\nPilot— A pilot must continually make decisions about\\ncompetency, condition of health, mental and emotional\\nstate, level of fatigue, and many other variables. For\\nexample, a pilot may be called early in the morning to\\nmake a long flight. If a pilot has had only a few hours\\nof sleep and is concerned that the congestion being\\nexperienced could be the onset of a cold, it would be\\nprudent to consider if the flight could be accomplished\\nsafely.\\nA pilot had only 4 hours of sleep the night before.

Although the\\nquantity of oil seemed insignificant at the time, the pilot\\ndecided to delay the takeoff and have a mechanic check\\nthe source of the oil. The pilot’s good judgment was\\nconfirmed when the mechanic found that one of the oil\\ncooler hose fittings was loose. \\nEnvironment— This encompasses many elements not\\npilot or airplane related. It can include such factors as\\nweather, air traffic control, navaids, terrain, takeoff and\\nlanding areas, and surrounding obstacles. Weather is\\none element that can change drastically over time and\\ndistance.\\nA pilot was landing a small airplane just after a heavy\\njet had departed a parallel runway. The pilot assumed\\nthat wake turbulence would not be a problem since\\nlandings had been performed under similar circum-\\nstances. Due to a combination of prevailing winds and\\nwake turbulence from the heavy jet drifting across the\\nlanding runway, the airplane made a hard landing. The\\npilot made an error when assessing the flight environ-\\nment.\\nOperation— The interaction between the pilot, air-\\nplane, and the environment is greatly influenced by\\nthe purpose of each flight operation. The pilot must\\nevaluate the three previous areas to decide on the\\ndesirability of undertaking or continuing the flight as\\nplanned. It is worth asking why the flight is being\\nmade, how critical is it to maintain the schedule, and\\nis the trip worth the risks?\\nOn a ferry flight to deliver an airplane from the factory,\\nin marginal weather conditions, the pilot calculated the\\ngroundspeed and determined that the airplane would\\narrive at the destination with only 10 minutes of fuel\\nremaining. The pilot was determined to keep on sched-\\nule by trying to “stretch” the fuel supply instead of\\nlanding to refuel. After landing with low fuel state, the\\npilot realized that this could have easily resulted in an\\nemergency landing in deteriorating weather condi-\\ntions. This was a chance that was not worth taking to\\nkeep the planned schedule.\\nASSESSING RISK\\nExamining National Transportation Safety Board\\n(NTSB) reports and other accident research can help\\nassess risk more effectively. For example, the accident\\nrate during night VFR decreases by nearly 50 percent\\nonce a pilot obtains 100 hours, and continues to\\ndecrease until the 1,000-hour level. The data suggest\\nthat for the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night\\nmight want to establish higher personal limitations than\\nare required by the regulations and, if applicable, apply\\ninstrument flying skills in this environment. [Figure\\n16-4]\\nStudies also indicate the types of flight activities that\\nare likely to result in the most serious accidents. The\\nmajority of fatal general aviation accidents fall under\\nthe categories of takeoff/initial climb, maneuvering\\nflight, approaches, and weather. Delving deeper into\\naccident statistics can provide some important details\\nthat can help in understanding the risks involved with\\nspecific flying situations. For example, maneuvering\\nflight is one of the largest single producers of fatal\\naccidents. In the approach phase, fatal accidents often\\nhappen at night or in IFR conditions. Takeoff/initial\\nclimb accidents frequently are due to the pilot’s lack\\nof awareness of the effects of density altitude on air-\\nplane performance or other improper takeoff planning\\nresulting in loss of control during, or shortly after\\ntakeoff. The majority of weather-related accidents\\noccur after attempted VFR flight into IFR conditions.\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DECISION\\nMAKING\\nIt is important to point out the fact that being familiar\\nwith the decision-making process does not ensure the\\ngood judgment to be a safe pilot. The ability to make\\neffective decisions as pilot in command depends on a\\nnumber of factors. Some circumstances, such as the\\ntime available to make a decision may be beyond a\\npilot’s control. However, one can learn to recognize\\nthose factors that can be managed, and learn skills to\\nimprove decision-making ability and judgment.\\nPILOT SELF-ASSESSMENT\\nThe pilot in command of an airplane is directly\\nresponsible for, and is the final authority as to, the\\noperation of that airplane.

Often, pilots thoroughly check their\\nairplane to determine airworthiness, yet do not evaluate\\ntheir own fitness for flight. Just as a checklist is used\\nwhen preflighting an airplane, a personal checklist based\\non such factors as experience, currency, and comfort level\\ncan help determine if a pilot is prepared for a particular\\nflight. Specifying when refresher training should be\\naccomplished and designating weather minimums\\nthat may be higher than those listed in Title 14 of the\\nCode of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 are\\nelements that may be included on a personal check-\\nlist.

[Figure 16-5]\\nRECOGNIZING HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES\\nBeing fit to fly depends on more than just a pilot’s\\nphysical condition and recency of experience. For\\nexample, attitude will affect the quality of decisions.\\nAttitude can be defined as a personal motivational\\npredisposition to respond to persons, situations, or\\nevents in a given manner. Studies have identified five\\nhazardous attitudes that can interfere with the ability\\nto make sound decisions and exercise authority prop-\\nerly. [Figure 16-6]\\nHazardous attitudes can lead to poor decision making\\nand actions that involve unnecessary risk. The pilot\\nmust examine decisions carefully to ensure that the\\nchoices have not been influenced by hazardous atti-\\ntudes and be familiar with positive alternatives to\\ncounteract the hazardous attitudes. These substitute\\nattitudes are referred to as antidotes. During a flight\\noperation, it is important to be able to recognize a\\nhazardous attitude, correctly label the thought, and\\nthen recall its antidote. [Figure 16-7]\\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT\\nEveryone is stressed to some degree almost all the\\ntime. A certain amount of stress is good since it keeps\\na person alert and prevents complacency. However,\\neffects of stress are cumulative and, if not coped with\\nadequately, they eventually add up to an intolerable\\nburden.

Prior to flight, pilot fitness should be assessed\\nthe same as the airplane’s airworthiness is evaluated.\\nTHE FIVE HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES\\n1.  Anti-Authority:\\n\"Don\\'t tell me.\"\\nThis attitude is found in people who do not like anyone telling them what to do. In a sense, they \\nare saying, \"No one can tell me what to do.\" They may be resentful of having someone tell them \\nwhat to do, or may regard rules, regulations, and procedures as silly or unnecessary. However, it \\nis always your prerogative to question authority if you feel it is in error.\\nThis is the attitude of people who frequently feel the need to do something, anything, immediately. \\nThey do not stop to think about what they are about to do; they do not select the best alternative, \\nand they do the first thing that comes to mind.\\nMany people feel that accidents happen to others, but never to them. They know accidents can \\nhappen, and they know that anyone can be affected. They never really feel or believe that they will \\nbe personally involved. Pilots who think this way are more likely to take chances and increase risk.\\nPilots who are always trying to prove that they are better than anyone else are thinking, \"I can do it \\n–I\\'ll show them.\" Pilots with this type of attitude will try to prove themselves by taking risks in order \\nto impress others. While this pattern is thought to be a male characteristic, women are equally \\nsusceptible.\\nPilots who think, \"What\\'s the use?\" do not see themselves as being able to make a great deal of \\ndifference in what happens to them. When things go well, the pilot is apt to think that it is good luck. \\nWhen things go badly, the pilot may feel that someone is out to get me, or attribute it to bad luck. \\nThe pilot will leave the action to others, for better or worse. Sometimes, such pilots will even go \\nalong with unreasonable requests just to be a \"nice guy.\"\\n2.  Impulsivity:\\n\"Do it quickly.\"\\n3.  Invulnerability:\\n\"It won\\'t happen to me.\"\\n4.  Macho:\\n\"I can do it.\"\\n5.  Resignation:\\n\"What\\'s the use?\"\\nFigure 16-6.

Factors, referred to as\\nstressors, can increase a pilot’s risk of error in the\\ncockpit. [Figure 16-8]\\nThere are several techniques to help manage the accu-\\nmulation of life stresses and prevent stress overload. For\\nexample, including relaxation time in a busy schedule\\nand maintaining a program of physical fitness can help\\nreduce stress levels. Learning to manage time more\\neffectively can help avoid heavy pressures imposed by\\ngetting behind schedule and not meeting deadlines.\\nTake a self-assessment to determine capabilities and\\nlimitations and then set realistic goals. In addition,\\navoiding stressful situations and encounters can help to\\ncope with stress.\\nUSE OF RESOURCES\\nTo make informed decisions during flight operations, a\\npilot must become aware of the resources found both\\ninside and outside the cockpit. Since useful tools and\\nsources of information may not always be readily\\napparent, learning to recognize these resources is an\\nessential part of ADM training. Resources must not\\nonly be identified, but a pilot must develop the skills to\\nevaluate whether there is time to use a particular\\nresource and the impact that its use will have upon the\\nsafety of flight. For example, the assistance of air traf-\\nfic control (ATC) may be very useful if a pilot becomes\\nlost. However, in an emergency situation when action\\nneeds be taken quickly, time may not be available to\\ncontact ATC immediately.\\nINTERNAL RESOURCES\\nInternal resources are found in the cockpit during\\nflight. Since some of the most valuable internal\\nresources are ingenuity, knowledge, and skill, a pilot\\ncan expand cockpit resources immensely by improving\\nthese capabilities. This can be accomplished by fre-\\nquently reviewing flight information publications, such\\nas the CFRs and the Aeronautical Information Manual\\n(AIM), as well as by pursuing additional training.\\nA thorough understanding of all the equipment and sys-\\ntems in the airplane is necessary to fully utilize all\\nresources. For example, advanced navigation and\\nautopilot systems are valuable resources. However, if\\npilots do not fully understand how to use this equipment,\\nAnti-Authority — Although he \\nknows that flying so low to the \\nground is prohibited by the \\nregulations, he feels that the \\nregulations are too restrictive in \\nsome circumstances. \\nImpulsivity — As he is buzzing the \\npark, the airplane does not climb as \\nwell as Steve had anticipated and \\nwithout thinking, Steve pulls back \\nhard on the yoke. The airspeed \\ndrops and the airplane is close to a \\nstalling attitude as the wing brushes \\na power line.\\nInvulnerability — Steve is not \\nworried about an accident since he \\nhas flown this low many times before \\nand he has not had any problems.\\nMacho — Steve often brags to his \\nfriends about his skills as a pilot and \\nhow close to the ground he flies. \\nDuring a local pleasure flight in his \\nsingle-engine airplane, he decides to \\nbuzz some friends barbecuing at a \\nnearby park.\\nResignation — Although Steve \\nmanages to recover, the wing \\nsustains minor damage. Steve thinks \\nto himself, \"It\\'s dangerous for the \\npower company to put those lines so \\nclose to a park. If somebody finds \\nout about this I\\'m going to be in \\ntrouble, but it seems like no matter \\nwhat I do, somebody\\'s always going \\nto criticize.\"\\nFollow the rules. \\nThey are usually \\nright.\\nNot so fast.

This type of stress may also be related to mental workload, such as \\nanalyzing a problem, navigating an aircraft, or making decisions.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-7'),\n",

In addition, the\\nAirplane Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook\\n(AFM/POH), which is required to be carried on board\\nthe airplane, is essential for accurate flight planning\\nand for resolving in-flight equipment malfunctions.\\nOther valuable cockpit resources include current aero-\\nnautical charts and publications, such as the\\nAirport/Facility Directory.\\nPassengers can also be a valuable resource. Passengers\\ncan help watch for traffic and may be able to provide\\ninformation in an irregular situation, especially if they\\nare familiar with flying. A strange smell or sound may\\nalert a passenger to a potential problem. A pilot in com-\\nmand should brief passengers before the flight to make\\nsure that they are comfortable voicing any concerns.\\nEXTERNAL RESOURCES\\nPossibly the greatest external resources during flight\\nare air traffic controllers and flight service specialists.\\nATC can help decrease pilot workload by providing\\ntraffic advisories, radar vectors, and assistance in emer-\\ngency situations. Flight service stations can provide\\nupdates on weather, answer questions about airport\\nconditions, and may offer direction-finding assistance.\\nThe services provided by ATC can be invaluable in\\nenabling a pilot to make informed in-flight decisions.\\nWORKLOAD MANAGEMENT\\nEffective workload management ensures that essential\\noperations are accomplished by planning, prioritizing, and\\nsequencing tasks to avoid work overload. As experience is\\ngained, a pilot learns to recognize future workload\\nrequirements and can prepare for high workload periods\\nduring times of low workload. Reviewing the appropriate\\nchart and setting radio frequencies well in advance of\\nwhen they are needed helps reduce workload as the flight\\nnears the airport. In addition, a pilot should listen to A TIS,\\nASOS, or AWOS, if available, and then monitor the tower\\nfrequency or CTAF to get a good idea of what traffic con-\\nditions to expect. Checklists should be performed well in\\nadvance so there is time to focus on traffic and ATC\\ninstructions. These procedures are especially important\\nprior to entering a high-density traffic area, such as Class\\nB airspace.\\nTo manage workload, items should be prioritized.\\nDuring any situation, and especially in an emergency,\\nremember the phrase “aviate, navigate, and communi-\\ncate.” This means that the first thing the pilot should do\\nis to make sure the airplane is under control. Then\\nbegin flying to an acceptable landing area. Only after\\nthe first two items are assured should the pilot try to\\ncommunicate with anyone.\\nAnother important part of managing workload is\\nrecognizing a work overload situation. The first\\neffect of high workload is that the pilot begins to\\nwork faster. As workload increases, attention cannot\\nbe devoted to several tasks at one time, and the pilot\\nmay begin to focus on one item. When a pilot\\nbecomes task saturated, there is no awareness of\\ninputs from various sources, so decisions may be\\nmade on incomplete information, and the possibility\\nof error increases. [Figure 16-9]\\nWhen becoming overloaded, stop, think, slow down,\\nand prioritize. It is important to understand options that\\nmay be available to decrease workload. For example,\\ntasks such as locating an item on a chart or setting a\\nradio frequency may be delegated to another pilot or\\npassenger; an autopilot, if available, may be used; or\\nATC may be enlisted to provide assistance.\\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS\\nSituational awareness is the accurate perception of the\\noperational and environmental factors that affect the air-\\nplane, pilot, and passengers during a specific period of\\ntime. Maintaining situational awareness requires an\\nunderstanding of the relative significance of these factors\\nand their future impact on the flight.

A clear assessment of the status of\\nnavigation equipment can be obtained through\\nworkload management, and establishing a produc-\\ntive relationship with ATC can be accomplished by\\neffective resource use.\\nOBSTACLES TO MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL\\nAWARENESS\\nFatigue, stress, and work overload can cause a pilot to\\nfixate on a single perceived important item rather than\\nmaintaining an overall awareness of the flight situation.\\nA contributing factor in many accidents is a distraction\\nthat diverts the pilot’s attention from monitoring the\\ninstruments or scanning outside the airplane. Many\\ncockpit distractions begin as a minor problem, such as a\\ngauge that is not reading correctly, but result in accidents\\nas the pilot diverts attention to the perceived problem\\nand neglects to properly control the airplane.\\nComplacency presents another obstacle to maintaining\\nsituational awareness. When activities become routine,\\nthere is a tendency to relax and not put as much effort into\\nperformance. Like fatigue, complacency reduces a pilot’s\\neffectiveness in the cockpit. However, complacency is\\nharder to recognize than fatigue, since everything is per-\\nceived to be progressing smoothly. For example, a pilot\\nhas not bothered to calculate the CG of the airplane\\nbecause it has never been a problem. Without the pilot\\nrealizing it, a passenger loads a heavy piece of equipment\\nin the nose baggage compartment. The pilot notices severe\\nnose heaviness during climb-out after takeoff, and finds it\\nnecessary to use full nose-up trim to maintain level flight.\\nAs the pilot flares for landing, the elevator reaches the stop\\nwithout raising the nose enough, and the nose-first land-\\ning results in loss of the nose gear and extensive damage\\nto the airplane.\\nOPERATIONAL PITFALLS\\nThere are a number of classic behavioral traps into which\\npilots have been known to fall. Pilots, particularly those\\nwith considerable experience, as a rule, always try to\\ncomplete a flight as planned, please passengers, and\\nmeet schedules. The basic drive to meet or exceed goals\\ncan have an adverse effect on safety, and can impose an\\nunrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful\\nconditions. These tendencies ultimately may bring about\\npractices that are dangerous and often illegal, and may\\nlead to a mishap. A pilot will develop awareness and\\nlearn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls through\\neffective ADM training. [Figure 16-10]\\nPeer Pressure—Poor decision making may be based upon an emotional response to peers, rather than evaluating a situation \\nobjectively.\\nMind Set—A pilot displays mind set through an inability to recognize and cope with changes in a given situation. \\nGet-There-Itis—This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a \\ndisregard for any alternative course of action.\\nDuck-Under Syndrome—A pilot may be tempted to make it into an airport by descending below minimums during an \\napproach. There may be a belief that there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or a pilot may want to \\nadmit that the landing cannot be completed and a missed approach must be initiated.\\nScud Running—This occurs when a pilot tries to maintain visual contact with the terrain at low altitudes while instrument \\nconditions exist.\\nContinuing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) into Instrument Conditions—Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles \\nmay occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can be even more dangerous if the pilot is not \\ninstrument-rated or current.\\nGetting Behind the Aircraft—This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant \\nstate of surprise at what happens next may be exhibited when the pilot is getting behind the aircraft.\\nLoss of Positional or Situational Awareness—In extreme cases, when a pilot  gets behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or \\nsituational awareness may result. The pilot may not know the aircraft's geographical location, or may be unable to recognize \\ndeteriorating circumstances.\\nOperating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves —Ignoring minimum fuel reserve requirements is generally the result of \\noverconfidence, lack of flight planning, or disregarding applicable regulations.\\nDescent Below the Minimum En Route Altitude—The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the \\nen route portion of an IFR flight.\\nFlying Outside the Envelope—The assumed high performance capability of a particular aircraft may cause a mistaken belief \\nthat it can meet the demands imposed by a pilot's overestimated flying skills. \\nNeglect of Flight Planning, Preflight Inspections, and Checklists—A pilot may rely on short- and long-term memory, regular \\nflying skills, and familiar routes instead of established procedures and published checklists.

This hand-\\nbook introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot train-\\ning. Except for the Code of Federal Regulations pertinent to civil aviation, most of the knowledge areas applicable\\nto pilot certification are presented. This handbook is useful to beginning pilots, as well as those pursuing more\\nadvanced pilot certificates.\\nOccasionally, the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of\\nsuch language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal\\nRegulations (14 CFR).\\nIt is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR\\nand the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).\\nThe current Flight Standards Service airman training and testing material and subject matter knowledge codes for all\\nairman certificates and ratings can be obtained from the Flight Standards Service Web site at http://av-info.faa.gov.\\nThis handbook supersedes Advisory Circular (AC) 61-23C, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, dated\\n1997.\\nThis publication may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO),\\nWashington, DC 20402-9325, or from http://bookstore.gpo.gov.\\nThis handbook is published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Airman\\nTesting Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125.

Categories of aircraft for\\ncertification of airmen include airplane, rotorcraft,\\nlighter-than-air, powered-lift, and glider. Part 1 also\\ndefines airplane as an engine-driven, fixed-wing \\naircraft heavier than air that is supported in flight by the\\ndynamic reaction of air against its wings. This chapter\\nprovides a brief introduction to the airplane and its\\nmajor components.\\nMAJOR COMPONENTS\\nAlthough airplanes are designed for a variety of pur-\\nposes, most of them have the same major components.\\nThe overall characteristics are largely determined by\\nthe original design objectives. Most airplane structures\\ninclude a fuselage, wings, an empennage, landing gear,\\nand a powerplant. [Figure 1-1]\\nFigure 1-1.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='1-2\\nFUSELAGE\\nThe fuselage includes the cabin and/or cockpit, which\\ncontains seats for the occupants and the controls for\\nthe airplane. In addition, the fuselage may also\\nprovide room for cargo and attachment points for the\\nother major airplane components. Some aircraft uti-\\nlize an open truss structure. The truss-type fuselage is\\nconstructed of steel or aluminum tubing. Strength and\\nrigidity is achieved by welding the tubing together\\ninto a series of triangular shapes, called trusses.\\n[Figure 1-2]\\nConstruction of the Warren truss features longerons,\\nas well as diagonal and vertical web members. To\\nreduce weight, small airplanes generally utilize \\naluminum alloy tubing, which may be riveted or\\nbolted into one piece with cross-bracing members.\\nAs technology progressed, aircraft designers began to\\nenclose the truss members to streamline the airplane\\nand improve performance. This was originally accom-\\nplished with cloth fabric, which eventually gave way to\\nlightweight metals such as aluminum. In some cases,\\nthe outside skin can support all or a major portion of\\nthe flight loads. Most modern aircraft use a form of this\\nstressed skin structure known as monocoque or semi-\\nmonocoque construction.\\nThe monocoque design uses stressed skin to support\\nalmost all imposed loads. This structure can be very\\nstrong but cannot tolerate dents or deformation of the\\nsurface. This characteristic is easily demonstrated by a\\nthin aluminum beverage can. You can exert considerable\\nforce to the ends of the can without causing any damage.\\nHowever, if the side of the can is dented only slightly,\\nthe can will collapse easily. The true monocoque con-\\nstruction mainly consists of the skin, formers, and\\nbulkheads. The formers and bulkheads provide shape\\nfor the fuselage. [Figure 1-3]\\nSince no bracing members are present, the skin must be\\nstrong enough to keep the fuselage rigid. Thus, a \\nsignificant problem involved in monocoque construc-\\ntion is maintaining enough strength while keeping the\\nweight within allowable limits. Due to the limitations of\\nthe monocoque design, a semi-monocoque structure is\\nused on many of today’s aircraft.\\nThe semi-monocoque system uses a substructure to\\nwhich the airplane’s skin is attached. The substructure,\\nwhich consists of bulkheads and/or formers of various\\nsizes and stringers, reinforces the stressed skin by \\ntaking some of the bending stress from the fuselage.\\nThe main section of the fuselage also includes wing\\nattachment points and a firewall.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='1-3\\nOn single-engine airplanes, the engine is usually\\nattached to the front of the fuselage. There is a fireproof\\npartition between the rear of the engine and the cockpit\\nor cabin to protect the pilot and passengers from \\naccidental engine fires. This partition is called a \\nfirewall and is usually made of heat-resistant material\\nsuch as stainless steel.\\nWINGS\\nThe wings are airfoils attached to each side of the \\nfuselage and are the main lifting surfaces that support\\nthe airplane in flight. There are numerous wing\\ndesigns, sizes, and shapes used by the various manu-\\nfacturers. Each fulfills a certain need with respect to\\nthe expected performance for the particular airplane.\\nHow the wing produces lift is explained in subsequent\\nchapters.\\nWings may be attached at the top, middle, or lower por-\\ntion of the fuselage. These designs are referred to as\\nhigh-, mid-, and low-wing, respectively. The number of\\nwings can also vary. Airplanes with a single set of\\nwings are referred to as monoplanes, while those with\\ntwo sets are called biplanes. [Figure 1-5]\\nMany high-wing airplanes have external braces, or\\nwing struts, which transmit the flight and landing loads\\nthrough the struts to the main fuselage structure. Since\\nthe wing struts are usually attached approximately\\nhalfway out on the wing, this type of wing structure is\\ncalled semi-cantilever. A few high-wing and most \\nlow-wing airplanes have a full cantilever wing\\ndesigned to carry the loads without external struts.\\nThe principal structural parts of the wing are spars,\\nribs, and stringers. [Figure 1-6] These are reinforced by\\nAirfoil—An airfoil is any surface, such as a wing, propeller, rudder, or\\neven a trim tab, which provides aerodynamic force when it interacts\\nwith a moving stream of air.\\nMonoplane—An airplane that has only one main lifting surface or\\nwing, usually divided into two parts by the fuselage.\\nBiplane—An airplane that has two main airfoil surfaces or wings on\\neach side of the fuselage, one placed above the other.\\nFigure 1-5.

The wing ribs determine the shape and thickness\\nof the wing (airfoil). In most modern airplanes, the fuel\\ntanks either are an integral part of the wing’s structure,\\nor consist of flexible containers mounted inside of the\\nwing.\\nAttached to the rear, or trailing, edges of the wings are\\ntwo types of control surfaces referred to as ailerons and\\nflaps. Ailerons extend from about the midpoint of each\\nwing outward toward the tip and move in opposite\\ndirections to create aerodynamic forces that cause the\\nairplane to roll. Flaps extend outward from the \\nfuselage to near the midpoint of each wing. The flaps\\nare normally flush with the wing’s surface during \\ncruising flight. When extended, the flaps move simul-\\ntaneously downward to increase the lifting force of the\\nwing for takeoffs and landings.\\nEMPENNAGE\\nThe correct name for the tail section of an airplane is\\nempennage. The empennage includes the entire tail\\ngroup, consisting of fixed surfaces such as the vertical\\nstabilizer and the horizontal stabilizer. The movable sur-\\nfaces include the rudder, the elevator, and one or more\\ntrim tabs. [Figure 1-7]\\nA second type of empennage design does not require\\nan elevator. Instead, it incorporates a one-piece hori-\\nzontal stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point.\\nThis type of design is called a stabilator, and is moved\\nusing the control wheel, just as you would the eleva-\\ntor. For example, when you pull back on the control\\nwheel, the stabilator pivots so the trailing edge moves\\nup. This increases the aerodynamic tail load and\\ncauses the nose of the airplane to move up. Stabilators\\nhave an antiservo tab extending across their trailing\\nedge. [Figure 1-8]\\nThe antiservo tab moves in the same direction as the\\ntrailing edge of the stabilator. The antiservo tab also\\nfunctions as a trim tab to relieve control pressures and\\nhelps maintain the stabilator in the desired position.\\nThe rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabi-\\nlizer. During flight, it is used to move the airplane’s\\nnose left and right. The rudder is used in combination\\nwith the ailerons for turns during flight.

[Figure 1-9]\\nThe landing gear consists of three wheels—two main\\nwheels and a third wheel positioned either at the front or\\nrear of the airplane. Landing gear employing a rear-\\nmounted wheel is called conventional landing gear.\\nAirplanes with conventional landing gear are sometimes\\nreferred to as tailwheel airplanes.

The primary function of the engine is to\\nprovide the power to turn the propeller. It also gener-\\nates electrical power, provides a vacuum source for\\nsome flight instruments, and in most single-engine\\nairplanes, provides a source of heat for the pilot and\\npassengers. The engine is covered by a cowling, or in\\nthe case of some airplanes, surrounded by a nacelle.\\nThe purpose of the cowling or nacelle is to stream-\\nline the flow of air around the engine and to help cool\\nthe engine by ducting air around the cylinders. The\\npropeller, mounted on the front of the engine, trans-\\nlates the rotating force of the engine into a forward-\\nacting force called thrust that helps move the airplane\\nthrough the air.

To\\ncompetently control the airplane, the pilot must\\nunderstand the principles involved and learn to utilize\\nor counteract these natural forces.\\nModern general aviation airplanes have what may\\nbe considered high performance characteristics.\\nTherefore, it is increasingly necessary that pilots\\nappreciate and understand the principles upon which\\nthe art of flying is based.\\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE\\nThe atmosphere in which flight is conducted is an\\nenvelope of air that surrounds the earth and rests\\nupon its surface. It is as much a part of the earth as\\nthe seas or the land. However, air differs from land\\nand water inasmuch as it is a mixture of gases. It has\\nmass, weight, and indefinite shape.\\nAir, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its\\nshape when subjected to even minute pressures because\\nof the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example,\\ngas will completely fill any container into which it is\\nplaced, expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to\\nthe limits of the container.\\nThe atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21\\npercent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as\\nargon or helium. As some of these elements are heavier\\nthan others, there is a natural tendency of these heavier\\nelements, such as oxygen, to settle to the surface of the\\nearth, while the lighter elements are lifted up to the\\nregion of higher altitude. This explains why most of the\\noxygen is contained below 35,000 feet altitude.\\nBecause air has mass and weight, it is a body, and as a\\nbody, it reacts to the scientific laws of bodies in the\\nsame manner as other gaseous bodies. This body of air\\nresting upon the surface of the earth has weight and at\\nsea level develops an average pressure of 14.7 pounds\\non each square \\ninch of surface, or 29.92 inches of\\nch 02.qxd  11/19/03  7:27 AM  Page 2-1'),\n",

For this\\nreason, the weight of the atmosphere at 18,000 feet\\nis only one-half what it is at sea level. [Figure 2-1]\\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nThough there are various kinds of pressure, this\\ndiscussion is mainly concerned with atmospheric\\npressure. It is one of the basic factors in weather\\nchanges, helps to lift the airplane, and actuates some\\nof the important flight instruments in the airplane.\\nThese instruments are the altimeter, the airspeed\\nindicator, the rate-of-climb indicator, and the\\nmanifold pressure gauge.\\nThough air is very light, it has mass and is affected\\nby the attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other\\nsubstance, it has weight, and because of its weight, it\\nhas force. Since it is a fluid substance, this force is\\nexerted equally in all directions, and its effect on\\nbodies within the air is called pressure. Under\\nstandard conditions at sea level, the average pressure\\nexerted on the human body by the weight of the\\natmosphere around it is approximately 14.7 lb./in.\\nThe density of air has significant effects on the\\nairplane’s capability. As air becomes less dense, it\\nreduces (1) power because the engine takes in less\\nair, (2) thrust because the propeller is less efficient in\\nthin air, and (3) lift because the thin air exerts less\\nforce on the airfoils.\\nEFFECTS OF PRESSURE ON DENSITY\\nSince air is a gas, it can be compressed or expanded.\\nWhen air is compressed, a greater amount of air can\\noccupy a given volume. Conversely, when pressure\\non a given volume of air is decreased, the air\\nexpands and occupies a greater space. That is, the\\noriginal column of air at a lower pressure contains a\\nsmaller mass of air. In other words, the density is\\ndecreased. In fact, density is directly proportional to\\npressure. If the pressure is doubled, the density is\\ndoubled, and if the pressure is lowered, so is the\\ndensity. This statement is true, only at a\\nconstant temperature.\\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON DENSITY\\nThe effect of increasing the temperature of a\\nsubstance is to decrease its density. Conversely,\\ndecreasing the temperature has the effect of\\nincreasing the density. Thus, the density of air varies\\ninversely as the absolute temperature varies. This\\nstatement is true, only at a constant pressure.\\nIn the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure\\ndecrease with altitude, and have conflicting effects\\nupon density. However, the fairly rapid drop in\\npressure as altitude is increased usually has the\\ndominating effect. Hence, density can be expected to\\ndecrease with altitude.\\nEFFECT OF HUMIDITY ON DENSITY\\nThe preceding paragraphs have assumed that the air\\nwas perfectly dry. In reality, it is never completely\\ndry. The small amount of water vapor suspended in\\nthe atmosphere may be almost negligible under\\ncertain conditions, but in other conditions humidity\\nmay become an important factor in the performance\\nof an airplane. Water vapor is lighter than air;\\nconsequently, moist air is lighter than dry air. It is\\nlightest or least dense when, in a given set of\\nconditions, it contains the maximum amount of\\nwater vapor. The higher the temperature, the greater\\namount of water vapor the air can hold. When\\ncomparing two separate air masses, the first warm\\nand moist (both qualities tending to lighten the air)\\nand the second cold and dry (both qualities making it\\nheavier), the first necessarily must be less dense than\\nthe second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity\\nhave a great influence on airplane performance,\\nbecause of their effect upon density.\\nNEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION AND\\nFORCE\\nIn the 17th century, a philosopher and\\nmathematician, Sir Isaac Newton, propounded three\\nbasic laws of motion. It is certain that he did not have\\nthe airplane in mind when he did so, but almost\\neverything known about motion goes back to his\\nthree simple laws. These laws, named after Newton,\\nare as follows:\\nNewton’s first law states, in part, that: A body at rest\\ntends to remain at rest, and a body in motion tends to\\n29.92 30\\n25\\n20\\n15\\n10\\n  5\\n  0\\nInches of Mercury\\nAtmospheric\\nPressure\\nStandard\\nSea Level\\nPressure\\nFigure 2-1.

An airplane at rest on the ramp will remain at rest\\nunless a force strong enough to overcome its inertia is\\napplied. Once it is moving, however, its inertia keeps it\\nmoving, subject to the various other forces acting on it.\\nThese forces may add to its motion, slow it down, or\\nchange its direction.\\nNewton’s second law implies that: When a body is\\nacted upon by a constant force, its resulting\\nacceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the\\nbody and is directly proportional to the applied force.\\nWhat is being dealt with here are the factors involved\\nin overcoming Newton’s First Law of Inertia. It covers\\nboth changes in direction and speed, including starting\\nup from rest (positive acceleration) and coming to a\\nstop (negative acceleration, or deceleration).\\nNewton’s third law states that: Whenever one body\\nexerts a force on another, the second body always\\nexerts on the first, a force that is equal in magnitude but\\nopposite in direction.\\nThe recoil of a gun as it is fired is a graphic example of\\nNewton’s third law. The champion swimmer who\\npushes against the side of the pool during the\\nturnaround, or the infant learning to walk—both would\\nfail but for the phenomena expressed in this law. In an\\nairplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the air;\\nconsequently, the air pushes the propeller (and thus the\\nairplane) in\\nthe opposite direction—forward. In a jet\\nairplane, the engine pushes a blast of hot gases\\nbackward; the force of equal and opposite reaction\\npushes against the engine and forces the airplane\\nforward. The movement of all vehicles is a graphic\\nillustration of Newton’s third law.\\nMAGNUS EFFECT\\nThe explanation of lift can best be explained by looking\\nat a cylinder rotating in an airstream. The local velocity\\nnear the cylinder is composed of the airstream velocity\\nand the cylinder’s rotational velocity, which decreases\\nwith distance from the cylinder. On a cylinder, which is\\nrotating in such a way that the top surface area is rotating\\nin the same direction as the airflow, the local velocity at\\nthe surface is high on top and low on the bottom.\\nAs shown in figure 2-2, at point “A,” a stagnation point\\nexists where the airstream line that impinges on the\\nsurface splits; some air goes over and some under.\\nAnother stagnation point exists at “B,” where the two\\nairstreams rejoin and resume at identical velocities. We\\nnow have upwash ahead of the rotating cylinder and\\ndownwash at the rear.\\nThe difference in surface velocity accounts for a differ-\\nence in pressure, with the pressure being lower on the\\ntop than the bottom. This low pressure area produces an\\nupward force known as the “Magnus Effect.” This\\nmechanically induced circulation illustrates the\\nrelationship between circulation and lift.\\nAn airfoil with a positive angle of attack develops air\\ncirculation as its sharp trailing edge forces the rear\\nstagnation point to be aft of the trailing edge, while the\\nfront stagnation point is below the leading edge.\\n[Figure 2-3]\\nBERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE OF\\nPRESSURE\\nA half century after Sir Newton presented his laws,\\nMr. Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician,\\nexplained how the pressure of a moving fluid (liquid\\nor gas) varies with its speed of motion.

This is exactly what happens to air passing\\nover the curved top of the airplane wing.\\nAn appropriate analogy can be made with water\\nflowing through a garden hose. Water moving through\\na hose of constant diameter exerts a uniform pressure\\non the hose; but if the diameter of a section of the hose\\nis increased or decreased, it is certain to change the\\npressure of the water at that point. Suppose the hose\\nwas pinched, thereby constricting the area through\\nwhich the water flows. Assuming that the same volume\\nof water flows through the constricted portion of the\\nhose in the same period of time as before the hose was\\npinched, it follows that the speed of flow must increase\\nat that point.\\nTherefore, if a portion of the hose is constricted, it not\\nonly increases the speed of the flow, but also decreases\\nthe pressure at that point. Like results could be\\nachieved if streamlined solids (airfoils) were\\nintroduced at the same point in the hose. This same\\nprinciple is the basis for the measurement of airspeed\\n(fluid flow) and for analyzing the airfoil’s ability to\\nproduce lift.\\nA practical application of Bernoulli’s theorem is the\\nventuri tube. The venturi tube has an air inlet which\\nnarrows to a throat (constricted point) and an outlet\\nsection which increases in diameter \\ntoward the rear.\\nThe diameter of the outlet is the same as that of the\\ninlet. At the throat, the airflow speeds up and the\\npressure decreases; at the outlet, the airflow slows\\nand the pressure increases. [Figure 2-4]\\nIf air is recognized as a body and it is accepted that it\\nmust follow the above laws, one can begin to see\\nhow and why an airplane wing develops lift as it\\nmoves through the air.\\nAIRFOIL DESIGN\\nIn the sections devoted to Newton’s and Bernoulli’s\\ndiscoveries, it has already been discussed in general\\nterms the question of how an airplane wing can\\nsustain flight when the airplane is heavier than air.\\nPerhaps the explanation can best be reduced to its\\nmost elementary concept by stating that lift (flight)\\nis simply the result of fluid flow (air) about an\\nairfoil—or in everyday language, the result of\\nmoving an airfoil (wing), by whatever means,\\nthrough the air.\\nSince it is the airfoil which harnesses the force\\ndeveloped by its movement through the air, a\\ndiscussion and explanation of this structure, as well as\\nsome of the material presented in previous discussions\\non Newton’s and Bernoulli’s laws, will be presented.\\nAn airfoil is a structure designed to obtain reaction\\nupon its surface from the air through which it moves or\\nthat moves past such a structure. Air acts in various\\nways when submitted to different pressures and\\nvelocities; but this discussion will be confined to the\\nparts of an airplane that a pilot is most concerned with\\nin flight—namely, the airfoils designed to produce lift.\\nBy looking at a typical airfoil profile, such as the cross\\nsection of a wing, one can see several obvious\\ncharacteristics of design. [Figure 2-5] Notice that there\\nis a difference in the curvatures of the upper and lower\\nsurfaces of the airfoil (the curvature is called camber).\\nThe camber of the upper surface is more pronounced\\nthan that of the lower surface, which is somewhat flat\\nin most instances.\\nIn figu\\nre 2-5, note that the two extremities of the\\nairfoil profile also differ in appearance. The end\\nwhich faces forward in flight is called the leading\\nedge, and is rounded; while the other end, the\\ntrailing edge, is quite narrow and tapered.\\nLeading\\nEdge\\nTrailing\\nEdge\\nCamber of Upper Surface\\nCamber of Lower Surface\\nChord Line\\nFigure 2-5.

The distance from this chord line to the upper\\nand lower surfaces of the wing denotes the magnitude\\nof the upper and lower camber at any point. Another\\nreference line, drawn from the leading edge to the\\ntrailing edge, is the “mean camber line.” This mean line\\nis equidistant at all points from the upper and\\nlower contours.\\nThe construction of the wing, so as to provide actions\\ngreater than its weight, is done by shaping the wing so\\nthat advantage can be taken of the air’s response to\\ncertain physical laws, and thus develop two actions\\nfrom the air mass; a positive pressure lifting action\\nfrom the air mass below the wing, and a negative\\npressure lifting action from lowered pressure above the\\nwing.\\nAs the airstream strikes the relatively flat lower surface\\nof the wing when inclined at a small a\\nngle to its\\ndirection of motion, the air is forced to rebound\\ndownward and therefore causes an upward reaction\\nin positive lift, while at the same time airstream\\nstriking the upper curved section of the “leading\\nedge” of the wing is deflected upward. In other\\nwords, a wing shaped to cause an action on the air,\\nand forcing it downward, will provide an equal\\nreaction from the air, forcing the wing upward. If a\\nwing is constructed in such form that it will cause a\\nlift force greater than the weight of the airplane, the\\nairplane will fly.\\nHowever, if all the lift required were obtained merely\\nfrom the deflection of air by the lower surface of the\\nwing, an airplane would need only a flat wing like a\\nkite. This, of course, is not the case at all; under certain\\nconditions disturbed air currents circulating at the\\ntrailing edge of the wing could be so excessive as to\\nmake the airplane lose speed and lift. The balance of\\nthe lift needed to support the airplane comes from the\\nflow of air above the wing. Herein lies the key to flight.\\nThe fact that most lift is the result of the airflow’s\\ndownwash from above the wing, must be thoroughly\\nunderstood in order to continue further in the study of\\nflight. It is neither accurate nor does it serve a useful\\npurpose, however, to assign specific values to the\\npercentage of lift generated by the upper surface of an\\nairfoil versus that generated by the lower surface.\\nThese are not constant values and will vary, not only\\nwith flight conditions, but with different wing designs.\\nIt should be understood that different airfoils have\\ndifferent flight characteristics. Many thousands of\\nairfoils have been tested in wind tunnels and in actual\\nflight, but no one airfoil has been found t\\nhat satisfies\\nevery flight requirement. The weight, speed, and\\npurpose of each airplane dictate the shape of its\\nairfoil. It was learned many years ago that the most\\nefficient airfoil for producing the greatest lift was\\none that had a concave, or “scooped out” lower\\nsurface. Later it was also learned that as a fixed\\ndesign, this type of airfoil sacrificed too much speed\\nwhile producing lift and, therefore, was not suitable\\nfor high-speed flight. It is interesting to note,\\nhowever, that through advanced progress in\\nengineering, today’s high-speed jets can again take\\nadvantage of the concave airfoil’s high lift\\ncharacteristics. Leading edge (Kreuger) flaps and\\ntrailing edge (Fowler) flaps, when extended from the\\nbasic wing structure, literally change the\\nairfoil shape into the classic concave form,\\nthereby generating much greater lift during slow\\nflight conditions.\\nOn the other hand, an airfoil that is perfectly\\nstreamlined and offers little wind resistance\\nsometimes does not have enough lifting power to\\ntake the airplane off the ground. Thus, modern\\nairplanes have airfoils which strike a medium\\nbetween extremes in design, the shape varying\\naccording to the needs of the airplane for which it is\\ndesigned. Figure 2-6 shows some of the more\\ncommon airfoil sections.\\nLOW PRESSURE ABOVE\\nIn a wind tunnel or in flight, an airfoil is simply a\\nstreamlined object inserted into a moving stream of\\nair. If the airfoil profile were in the shape of a\\nteardrop, the speed and the pressure changes of the\\nair passing over the top and bottom would be the\\nsame on both sides. But if the teardrop shaped airfoil\\nwere cut in half lengthwise, a form resembling the\\nbasic airfoil (wing) section would result. If the\\nairfoil were then inclined so the airflow strikes it at\\nan angle (angle of attack), the air molecules moving\\nover the upper surface would be forced to move\\nfaster than would the molecules moving along the\\nbottom of the airfoil, since the upper molecules must\\ntravel a greater distance due to the curvature of the\\nupper surface. This increased velocity reduces the\\npressure above the airfoil.\\nEarly Airfoil Laminar Flow Airfoil\\n(Subsonic)\\nLater Airfoil\\nCircular Arc Airfoil\\n(Supersonic)\\nDouble Wedge Airfoil\\n(Supersonic)\\nClark 'Y' Airfoil\\n(Subsonic)\\nFigure 2-6.

A discussion of the influence of\\nmomentum of the air as it flows in various curved\\npaths near the airfoil will be presented. [Figure 2-7]\\nMomentum is the resistance a moving body offers to\\nhaving its direction or amount of motion changed.\\nWhen a body is forced to move in a circular path, it\\noffers resistance in the direction away from the\\ncenter of the curved path. This is “centrifugal force.”\\nWhile the particles of air move in the curved path\\nAB, centrifugal force tends to throw them in the\\ndirection of the arrows between A and B and hence,\\ncauses the air to exert more than normal pressure on\\nthe leading edge of the airfoil. But after the air\\nparticles pass B (the point of reversal of the\\ncurvature of the path) the centrifugal force tends to\\nthrow them in the direction of the arrows between B\\nand C (causing reduced pressure on the airfoil). This\\neffect is held until the particles reach C, the second\\npoint of reversal of curvature of the airflow. Again\\nthe centrifugal force is reversed and the particles\\nmay even tend to give slightly more than normal\\npressure on the trailing edge of the airfoil, as\\nindicated by the short arrows between C and D.\\nTherefore, the air pressure on the upper surface of\\nthe airfoil is distributed so that the pressure is much\\ngreater on the leading edge than the surrounding\\natmospheric pressure, causing strong resistance to\\nforward motion; but the air pressure is less than\\nsurrounding atmospheric pressure over a large\\nportion of the top surface (B to C).\\nAs seen in the application of Bernoulli’s theorem to a\\nventuri, the speedup of air on the top of an airfoil\\nproduces a drop in pressure. This lowered pressure is a\\ncomponent of total lift. It is a mistake, however, to\\nassume that the pressure difference between the upper\\nand lower surface of a wing alone accounts for the total\\nlift force produced.\\nOne must also bear in mind that associated with the\\nlowered pressure is downwash; a downward backward\\nflow from the top surface of the wing. As already seen\\nfrom previous discussions r\\nelative to the dynamic\\naction of the air as it strikes the lower surface of the\\nwing, the reaction of this downward backward flow\\nresults in an upward forward force on the wing. This\\nsame reaction applies to the flow of air over the top\\nof the airfoil as well as to the bottom, and Newton’s\\nthird law is again in the picture.\\nHIGH PRESSURE BELOW\\nIn the section dealing with Newton’s laws as they\\napply to lift, it has already been discussed how a\\ncertain amount of lift is generated by pressure\\nconditions underneath the wing. Because of the\\nmanner in which air flows underneath the wing, a\\npositive pressure results, particularly at higher\\nangles of attack. But there is another aspect to this\\nairflow that must be considered. At a point close to\\nthe leading edge, the airflow is virtually stopped\\n(stagnation point) and then gradually increases\\nspeed. At some point near the trailing edge, it has\\nagain reached a velocity equal to that on the upper\\nsurface. In conformance with Bernoulli’s principles,\\nwhere the airflow was slowed beneath the wing, a\\npositive upward pressure was created against the\\nwing; i.e., as the fluid speed decreases, the pressure\\nmust increase. In essence, this simply “accentuates\\nthe positive” since it increases the pressure\\ndifferential between the upper and lower surface of\\nthe airfoil, and therefore increases total lift over that\\nwhich would have resulted had there been no\\nincrease of pressure at the lower surface. Both\\nBernoulli’s principle and Newton’s laws are in\\noperation whenever lift is being generated by\\nan airfoil.\\nFluid flow or airflow then, is the basis for flight in\\nairplanes, and is a product of the velocity of the\\nairplane. The velocity of the airplane is very\\nimportant to the pilot since it affects the lift and drag\\nforces of the airplane. The pilot uses the velocity\\n(airspeed) to fly at a minimum glide angle, at\\nmaximum endurance, and for a number of other\\nflight maneuvers. Airspeed is the velocity of the\\nairplane relative to the air mass through which it\\nis flying.\\nPRESSURE DISTRIBUTION\\nFrom experiments conducted on wind tunnel models\\nand on full size airplanes, it has been determined that\\nas air flows along the surface of a wing at different\\nangles of attack, there are regions along the surface\\nwhere the pressure is negative, or less than\\natmospheric, and regions where the pressure is\\npositive, or greater than atmospheric. This negative\\npressure on the upper surface creates a relatively\\nlarger force on the wing than is caused by the\\npositive pressure resulting from the air striking the\\nlower wing surface.

In\\nthe design of wing structures, this center of pressure\\ntravel is very important, since it affects the position\\nof the airloads imposed on the wing structure in low\\nangle-of-attack conditions and high angle-of-attack\\nconditions. The airplane’s aerodynamic balance and\\ncontrollability are governed by changes in the center\\nof pressure.\\nThe center of pressure is determined through\\ncalculation and wind tunnel tests by varying the\\nairfoil’s angle of attack through normal operating\\nextremes. As the angle of attack is changed, so are\\nthe various pressure distribution characteristics.\\n[Figure 2-8] Positive (+) and negative (–) pressure\\nforces are totaled for each angle of attack and the\\nresultant force is obtained. The total resultant\\npressure is represented by the resultant force vector\\nshown in figure 2-9. \\nThe point of application of this force vector is\\ntermed the “center of pressure” (CP). For any given\\nangle of attack, the center of pressure is the point\\nwhere the resultant force crosses the chord line. This\\npoint is expressed as a percentage of the chord of the\\nairfoil. A center of pressure at 30 percent of a 60-\\ninch chord would be 18 inches aft of the wing’s\\nleading edge. It would appear then that if the\\ndesigner would place the wing so that its center of\\npressure was at the airplane’s center of gravity, the\\nairplane would always balance. The difficulty arises,\\nhowever, that the location of the center of pressure\\nchanges with change in the airfoil’s angle of attack.\\n[Figure 2-10]\\nIn the airplane’s normal range of flight attitudes, if\\nthe angle of attack is increased, the center of\\npressure moves forward; and if decreased, it moves\\nrearward. Since the center of gravity is fixed at one\\npoint, it is evident that as the angle of attack\\nincreases, the center of lift (CL) moves ahead of the\\ncenter of gravity, creating a force which tends to\\nraise the nose of the airplane or tends to increase the\\nangle of attack still more. On the other hand, if the\\nangle of attack is decreased, the center of lift (CL)\\nmoves aft and tends to decrease the angle a greater\\namount. It is seen then, that the ordinary airfoil is\\ninherently unstable, and that an auxiliary device,\\nsuch as the horizontal tail surface, must be added to\\nmake the airplane balance longitudinally.\\nThe balance of an airplane in flight depends, therefore,\\non the relative position of the center of gravity (CG)\\nand the center of pressure (CP) of the airfoil.\\nExperience has shown that an airplane with the center\\n+4°\\n  +10°Angle of\\nAttack\\nAngle of\\nAttack  \\n-8°Angle of\\nAttack\\nFigure 2-8.

It is the bal-\\nance between these forces that the pilot must always\\ncontrol. The better the understanding of the forces and\\nmeans of controlling them, the greater will be the\\npilot’s skill at doing so.\\nThe following defines these forces in relation to\\nstraight-and-level, unaccelerated flight.\\nThrust is the forward force produced by the power-\\nplant/propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of\\ndrag. As a general rule, it is said to act parallel to the\\nlongitudinal axis. However, this is not always the case\\nas will be explained later.\\nDrag is a rearward, retarding force, and is caused by\\ndisruption of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other\\nprotruding objects. Drag opposes thrust, and acts rear-\\nward parallel to the relative wind.\\nWeight is the combined load of the airplane itself, the\\ncrew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls\\nthe airplane downward because of the force of gravity.\\nIt opposes lift, and acts vertically downward through\\nthe airplane’s center of gravity.\\nLift opposes the downward force of weight, is pro-\\nduced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the\\nwing, and acts perpendicular to the flightpath through\\nthe wing’s center of lift.\\nIn steady flight, the sum of these opposing forces is\\nequal to zero. There can be no unbalanced forces in\\nsteady, straight flight (Newton’s Third Law). This is\\ntrue whether flying level or when \\nclimbing or\\ndescending. This is not the same thing as saying that\\nthe four forces are all equal. It simply means that\\nthe opposing forces are equal to, and thereby cancel\\nthe effects of, each other. Often the relationship\\nbetween the four forces has been erroneously\\nexplained or illustrated in such a way that this point\\nis obscured. Consider figure 3-1 on the next page,\\nfor example. In the upper illustration the force vectors\\nof thrust, drag, lift, and weight appear to be equal in\\nvalue. The usual explanation states (without stipulat-\\ning that thrust and drag do not equal weight and lift)\\nthat thrust equals drag and lift equals weight as shown\\nin the lower illustration. This basically true statement\\nmust be understood or it can be misleading. It should\\nbe understood that in straight, level, unaccelerated\\nflight, it is true that the opposing lift/weight forces\\nare equal, but they are also greater than the oppos-\\ning forces of thrust/drag that are equal only to each\\nother; not to lift/weight. To be correct about it, it\\nmust be said that in steady flight:\\n• The sum of all upward forces (not just lift) equals\\nthe sum of all downward forces (not just weight).\\n• The sum of all forward forces (not just thrust)\\nequals the sum of all backward forces (not just\\ndrag).\\nThis refinement of the old “thrust equals drag; lift\\nequals weight” formula takes into account the fact that\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-1'),\n",

In glides, a\\nportion of the weight vector is directed forward, and\\ntherefore acts as thrust. In other words, any time the\\nflightpath of the airplane is not horizontal, lift, weight,\\nthrust, and drag vectors must each be broken down into\\ntwo components. [Figure 3-2]\\nFigure 3-2. Force vectors during a stabilized climb.\\nDiscussions of the preceding concepts are frequently\\nomitted in aeronautical texts/handbooks/manuals. The\\nreason is not that they are of no consequence, but\\nbecause by omitting such discussions, the main ideas\\nwith respect to the aerodynamic forces acting upon\\nan airplane in flight can be presented in their most\\nessential elements without being involved in the\\ntechnicalities of the aerodynamicist. In point of fact,\\nconsidering only level flight, and normal climbs and\\nglides in a steady state, it is still true that wing lift is\\nthe really important upward force, and weight is the\\nreally important downward force.\\nFrequently, much of the difficulty encountered in\\nexplaining the forces that act upon an airplane is largely\\na matter of language and its meaning. For example,\\npilots have long believed that an airplane climbs\\nbecause of excess lift. This is not true if one is thinking\\nin terms of wing lift alone. It is true, however, if by lift\\nit is meant the sum total of all “upward forces.” But\\nwhen referring to the “lift of thrust” or the “thrust of\\nweight,” the definitions previously established for\\nthese forces are no longer valid and complicate mat-\\nters. It is this impreciseness in language that affords the\\nexcuse to engage in arguments, largely academic, over\\nrefinements to basic principles.\\nThough\\nthe forces acting on an airplane have already\\nbeen defined, a discussion in more detail to establish\\nhow the pilot uses them to produce controlled flight\\nis appropriate.\\nTHRUST\\nBefore the airplane begins to move, thrust must be\\nexerted. It continues to move and gain speed until\\nthrust and drag are equal. In order to maintain a con-\\nstant airspeed, thrust and drag must remain equal,\\njust as lift and weight must be equal to maintain a\\nconstant altitude. If in level flight, the engine power\\nis reduced, the thrust is lessened, and the airplane\\nslows down. As long as the thrust is less than the\\ndrag, the airplane continues to decelerate until its\\nairspeed is insufficient to support it in the air.\\nLikewise, if the engine power is increased, thrust\\nbecomes greater than drag and the airspeed\\nincreases. As long as the thrust continues to be\\ngreater than the drag, the airplane continues to accel-\\nerate. When drag equals thrust, the airplane flies at a\\nconstant airspeed.\\nStraight-and-level flight may be sustained at speeds\\nfrom very slow to very fast. The pilot must coordi-\\nnate angle of attack and thrust in all speed regimes if\\nthe airplane is to be held in level flight. Roughly,\\nthese regimes can be grouped in three categories:\\nlow-speed flight, cruising flight, and high-speed\\nflight.\\nWhen the airspeed is low, the angle of attack must be\\nrelatively high to increase lift if the balance between\\nlift and weight is to be maintained.

To maintain level flight, the pilot can\\nincrease the angle of attack an amount which will\\ngenerate a lift force again equal to the weight of the\\nairplane and while the airplane will be flying more\\nslowly, it will still maintain level flight if the pilot\\nhas properly coordinated thrust and angle of attack.\\nStraight-and-level flight in the slow speed regime\\nprovides some interesting conditions relative to the\\nequilibrium of forces, because with the airplane in a\\nnose-high attitude, there is a vertical component of\\nthrust that helps support the airplane. For one thing,\\nwing loading tends to be less than would be\\nexpected. Most pilots are aware that an airplane will\\nstall, other conditions being equal, at a slower speed\\nwith the power on than with the power off. (Induced\\nairflow over the wings from the propeller also con-\\ntributes to this.) However, if analysis is restricted to\\nthe four forces as they are usually defined, one can\\nsay that in straight-and-level slow speed flight the\\nthrust is equal to drag, and lift is equal to weight.\\nDuring straight-and level-flight when thrust is\\nincreased and the airspeed increases, the angle of\\nattack must be decreased. That is, if changes have\\nbeen coordinated, the airplane will still remain in\\nlevel flight but at a higher speed when the proper\\nrelationship between thrust and angle of attack is\\nestablished.\\nIf the angle of attack were not coordinated\\n(decreased) with this increase of thrust, the airplane\\nwould climb. But decreasing the angle of attack\\nmodifies the lift, keeping it equal to the weight, and\\nif properly done, the airplane still remains in level\\nflight. Level flight at even slightly negative angles of\\nattack is possible at very high speed. It is evident\\nthen, that level flight can be performed with any\\nangle of attack between stalling angle and the rela-\\ntively small negative angles found at high speed.\\nDRAG\\nDrag in flight is of two basic types: parasite drag\\nand induced drag. The first is called parasite\\nbecause it in no way functions to aid flight, while\\nthe second is induced or created as a result of the\\nwing developing lift.\\nParasite drag is composed of two basic elements:\\nform drag, resulting from the disruption of the\\nstreamline flow; and the resistance of skin friction.\\nOf the two components of parasite drag, form drag is\\nthe easier to reduce when designing an airplane. In\\ngeneral, a more streamlined object produces the best\\nform to reduce parasite drag.\\nSkin friction is the type of parasite drag that is most\\ndifficult to reduce. No surface is perfectly smooth.\\nEven machined surfaces, when inspected through\\nmagnification, have a ragged, uneven appearance.\\nThis rough surface will deflect the streamlines of air\\non the surface, causing resistance to smooth airflow.\\nSkin friction can be minimized by employing a glossy,\\nflat finish to surfaces, and by eliminating protruding\\nrivet heads, roughness, and other irregularities.\\nAnother element must be added to the considera-\\ntion of parasite drag when designing an airplane.\\nThis drag combines the effects of form drag and\\nskin friction and is called interference drag. If two\\nobjects are placed adjacent to one another, the\\nresulting turbulence produced may be 50 to 200\\npercent greater than the parts tested separately.\\nThe three elements, form drag, skin friction, and\\ninterference drag, are all computed to determine\\nparasite drag on an airplane.\\nShape of an object is a big factor in parasite drag.\\nHowever, indicated airspeed is an equally important\\nfactor when speaking of parasite drag. The profile\\ndrag of a streamlined object held in a fixed position\\nrelative to the airflow increases approximately as the\\nsquare of the velocity; thus, doubling the airspeed\\nincreases the drag four times, and tripling the airspeed\\nincreases the drag nine times. This relationship, how-\\never, holds good only at comparatively low subsonic\\nspeeds. At some higher airspeeds, the rate at which\\nprofile drag has been increased with speed suddenly\\nbegins to increase more rapidly.\\nThe second basic type of drag is induced drag. It is\\nan established physical fact that no system, which\\ndoes work in the mechanical sense, can be 100 per-\\ncent efficient.

The more efficient the system,\\nthe smaller this loss.\\nIn level flight the aerodynamic properties of the wing\\nproduce a required lift, but this can be obtained only\\nat the expense of a certain penalty. The name given to\\nthis penalty is induced drag. Induced drag is inherent\\nwhenever a wing is producing lift and, in fact, this\\ntype of drag is inseparable from the production of lift.\\nConsequently, it is always present if lift is produced.\\nThe wing produces the lift force by making use of\\nthe energy of the free airstream. Whenever the wing\\nis producing lift, the pressure on the lower surface of\\nthe wing is greater than that on the upper surface. As\\na result, the air tends to flow from the high pressure\\narea below the wingtip upward to the low pressure\\narea above the wing. In the vicinity of the wingtips,\\nthere is a tendency for these pressures to equalize,\\nresulting in a lateral flow outward from the under-\\nside to the upper surface of the wing. This lateral\\nflow imparts a rotational velocity to the air at the\\nwingtips and trails behind the wing. Therefore, flow\\nabout the wingtips will be in the form of two vortices\\ntrailing behind as the wings move on.\\nWhen the airplane is viewed from the tail, these\\nvortices will circulate counterclockwise about the\\nright wingtip and clockwise about the left wingtip.\\n[Figure 3-4] Bearing in mind the direction of rota-\\ntion of these vortices, it can be seen that they induce\\nan upward flow of air beyond the wingtip, and a\\ndownwash flow behind the wing’s trailing edge. This\\ninduced downwash has nothing in common with the\\ndownwash that is necessary to produce lift. It is, in\\nfact, the source of induced drag. The greater the size\\nand strength of the vortices and consequent down-\\nwash component on the net airflow over the wing,\\nthe greater the induced drag effect becomes. This\\ndownwash over the top of the wing at the tip has the\\nsame effect as bending the lift vector rearward;\\ntherefore, the lift is slightly aft of perpendicular to\\nthe relative wind, creating a rearward lift component.\\nThis is induced drag.\\nIt should be remembered that in order to create a\\ngreater negative pressure on the top of the wing, the\\nwing can be inclined to a higher angle of attack; also,\\nthat if the angle of attack of an asymmetrical wing\\nwere zero, there would be no pressure differential\\nand consequently no downwash component; there-\\nfore, no induced drag. In any case, as angle of attack\\nincreases, induced drag increases proportionally.\\nTo state this another way—the lower the airspeed the\\ngreater the angle of attack required to produce lift\\nequal to the airplane’s weight and consequently, the\\ngreater will be the induced drag. The amount of\\ninduced drag varies inversely as the square of the\\nairspeed.\\nFrom the foregoing discussion, it can be noted that\\nparasite drag increases as the square of the airspeed,\\nand induced drag varies inversely as the square of\\nthe airspeed. It can be seen that as airspeed\\ndecreases to near the stalling speed, the total drag\\nbecomes greater, due mainly to the sharp rise in\\ninduced drag. Similarly, as the airspeed reaches the\\nterminal velocity of the airplane, the total drag\\nagain increases rapidly, due to the sharp increase\\nof parasite drag. As seen in figure 3-5, at some\\ngiven airspeed, total drag is at its maximum\\namount. This is very important in figuring the\\nmaximum endurance and range of airplanes; for\\nwhen drag is at a minimum, power required to\\novercome drag is also at a minimum.\\nTo understand the effect of lift and drag on an air-\\nplane in flight, both must be combined and the\\nlift/drag ratio considered.

Note that\\nthe maximum lift/drag ratio, (L/D max) occurs at one\\nspecific angle of attack and lift coefficient. If the air-\\nplane is operated in steady flight at L/D max, the\\ntotal drag is at a minimum. Any angle of attack lower\\nor higher than that for L/D max reduces the lift/drag\\nratio and consequently increases the total drag for a\\ngiven airplane’s lift.\\nThe location of the center of gravity (CG) is determined\\nby the general design of each particular airplane. The\\ndesigners determine how far the center of pressure (CP)\\nwill travel. They then fix the center of gravity forward\\nof the center of pressure for the corresponding flight\\nspeed in order to provide an adequate restoring moment\\nto retain flight equilibrium.\\nThe configuration of an airplane has a great effect on\\nthe lift/drag ratio. The high performance sailplane\\nmay have extremely high lift/drag ratios. The super-\\nsonic fighter may have seemingly low lift/drag ratios\\nin subsonic flight, but the airplane configurations\\nrequired for supersonic flight (and high L/Ds at high\\nMach numbers) cause this situation.\\nWEIGHT\\nGravity is the pulling force that tends to draw all\\nbodies to the center of the earth. The center of gravity\\n(CG) may be considered as a point at which all the\\nweight of the airplane is concentrated. If the airplane\\nwere supported at its exact center of gravity, it would\\nbalance in any attitude. It will be noted that center of\\ngravity is of major importance in an airplane, for its\\nposition has a great bearing upon stability.\\nThe location of the center of gravity is determined\\nby the general design of each particular airplane. The\\ndesigners determine how far the center of pressure\\n(CP) will travel. They then fix the center of gravity\\nforward of the center of pressure for the correspon-\\nding flight speed in order to provide an adequate\\nrestoring moment to retain flight equilibrium.\\nWeight has a definite relationship with lift, and thrust\\nwith drag. This relationship is simple, but important\\nin understanding the aerodynamics of flying. Lift\\nis the upward force on\\nthe wing acting perpen-\\ndicular to the relative\\nwind. Lift is required to\\ncounteract the airplane’s\\nweight (which is caused\\nby the force of gravity\\nacting on the mass of the\\nairplane). This weight\\n(gravity) force acts\\ndownward through the\\nairplane’s center of\\ngravity.

Any time the control\\nwheel is more fore or aft, the angle of attack is\\nchanged. As angle of attack increases, lift increases\\n(all other factors being equal). When the airplane\\nreaches the maximum angle of attack, lift begins to\\ndiminish rapidly. This is the stalling angle of attack,\\nor burble point.\\nBefore proceeding further with lift and how it can be\\ncontrolled, velocity must be interjected. The shape\\nof the wing cannot be effective unless it continually\\nkeeps “attacking” new air. If an airplane is to keep\\nflying, it must keep moving. Lift is proportional to\\nthe square of the airplane’s velocity. For example, an\\nairplane traveling at 200 knots has four times the lift\\nas the same airplane traveling at 100 knots, if the\\nangle of attack and other factors remain constant.\\nActually, the airplane could not continue to travel in\\nlevel flight at a constant altitude and maintain the\\nsame angle of attack if the velocity is increased. The\\nlift would increase and the airplane would climb as\\na result of the increased lift force. Therefore, to\\nmaintain the lift and weight forces in balance, and\\nto keep the airplane “straight and level” (not accel-\\nerating upward) in a state of equilibrium, as velocity\\nis increased, lift must be decreased. This is normally\\naccomplished by reducing the angle of attack; i.e.,\\nlowering the nose. Conversely, as the airplane is\\nslowed, the decreasing velocity requires increasing\\nthe angle of attack to maintain lift sufficient to\\nmaintain flight. There is, of course, a limit to how\\nfar the angle of attack can be increased, if a stall is\\nto be avoided.\\nTherefore, it may be concluded that for every angle\\nof attack there is a corresponding indicated airspeed\\nrequired to maintain altitude in steady, unaccelerated\\nflight—all other factors being constant. (Bear in\\nmind this is only true if maintaining “level flight.”)\\nSince an airfoil will always stall at the same angle\\nof attack, if increasing weight, lift must also be\\nincreased, and the only method for doing so is by\\nincreased velocity if the angle of attack is held\\nconstant just short of the “critical” or stalling angle\\nof attack.\\nLift and drag also vary directly with the density of\\nthe air. Density is affected by several factors: pres-\\nsure, temperature, and humidity. Remember, at an\\naltitude of 18,000 feet, the density of the air has\\none-half the density of air at sea level. Therefore,\\nin order to maintain its lift at a higher altitude, an\\nairplane must fly at a greater true airspeed for any\\ngiven angle of attack.\\nFurthermore, warm air is less dense than cool air,\\nand moist air is less dense than dry air. Thus, on a\\nhot humid day, an airplane must be flown at a greater\\ntrue airspeed for any given angle of attack than on a\\ncool, dry day.\\nIf the density factor is decreased and the total lift\\nmust equal the total weight to remain in flight, it\\nfollows that one of the other factors must be\\nincreased. The factors usually increased are the air-\\nspeed or the angle of attack, because these factors\\ncan be controlled directly by the pilot.\\nIt should also be pointed out that lift varies directly\\nwith the wing area, provided there is no change in\\nthe wing’s planform. If the wings have the same pro-\\nportion and airfoil sections, a wing with a planform\\narea of 200 square feet lifts twice as much at the\\nsame angle of attack as a wing with an area of 100\\nsquare feet.\\nAs can be seen, two major factors from the pilot’s\\nviewpoint are lift and velocity because these are the\\ntwo that can be controlled most readily and accu-\\nrately. Of course, the pilot can also control density\\nby adjusting the altitude and can control wing area\\nif the airplane happens to have flaps of the type that\\nenlarge wing area. However, for most situations, the\\npilot is controlling lift and velocity to maneuver the\\nairplane. For instance, in straight-and-level flight,\\ncruising along at a constant altitude, altitude is\\nmaintained by adjusting lift to match the airplane’s\\nvelocity or cruise airspeed, while maintaining a\\nstate of equilibrium where lift equals weight. In an\\napproach to landing, when the pilot wishes to land\\nas slowly as practical, it is necessary to increase lift\\nto near maximum to maintain lift equal to the weight\\nof the airplane.\\nWINGTIP VORTICES\\nThe action of the airfoil that gives an airplane lift\\nalso causes induced drag. It was determined that\\nwhen a wing is flown at a positive angle of attack, a\\npressure differential exists between the upper and\\nlower surfaces of the wing—that is, the pressure\\nabove the wing is less than atmospheric pressure and\\nthe pressure below the wing is equal to or greater\\nthan atmospheric pressure. Since air always moves\\nfrom high pressure toward low pressure, and the path\\nof least resistance is toward the airplane’s wingtips,\\nthere is a spanwise movement of air from the bottom\\nof the wing outward from the fuselage around the\\nwingtips. This flow of air results in “spillage” over\\nthe wingtips, thereby setting up a whirlpool of air\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-7\\ncalled a “vortex.” [Figure 3-4] At the same time, the\\nair on the upper surface of the wing has a tendency\\nto flow in toward the fuselage and off the trailing\\nedge. This air current forms a similar vortex at the\\ninboard portion of the trailing edge of the wing,\\nbut because the fuselage limits the inward flow, the\\nvortex is insignificant. Consequently, the deviation\\nin flow direction is greatest at the wingtips where\\nthe unrestricted lateral flow is the strongest. As the\\nair curls upward around the wingtip, it combines\\nwith the wing’s downwash to form a fast spinning\\ntrailing vortex. These vortices increase drag\\nbecause of energy spent in producing the turbu-\\nlence. It can be seen, then, that whenever the wing\\nis producing lift, induced drag occurs, and wingtip\\nvortices are created.\\nJust as lift increases with an increase in angle of\\nattack, induced drag also increases. This occurs\\nbecause as the angle of attack is increased, there is a\\ngreater pressure difference between the top and bot-\\ntom of the wing, and a greater lateral flow of air;\\nconsequently, this causes more violent vortices to be\\nset up, resulting in more turbulence and more\\ninduced drag.\\nThe intensity or strength of the wingtip vortices is\\ndirectly proportional to the weight of the airplane and\\ninversely proportional to the wingspan and speed of\\nthe airplane. The heavier and slower the airplane, the\\ngreater the angle of attack and the stronger the wingtip\\nvortices. Thus, an airplane will create wingtip vortices\\nwith maximum strength occurring during the takeoff,\\nclimb, and landing phases of flight.\\nGROUND EFFECT\\nIt is possible to fly an airplane just clear of the\\nground (or water) at a slightly slower airspeed\\nthan that required to sustain level flight at higher\\naltitudes. This is the result of a phenomenon,\\nwhich is better known than understood even by\\nsome experienced pilots.\\nWhen an airplane in flight\\ngets within several feet\\nfrom the ground surface, a\\nchange occurs in the three-\\ndimensional flow pattern\\naround the airplane because\\nthe vertical component of\\nthe airflow around the wing\\nis restricted by the ground\\nsurface. This alters the\\nwing’s upwash, downwash,\\nand wingtip vortices.\\n[Figure 3-7] These general\\neffects due to the presence\\nof the ground are referred to as “ground effect.”\\nGround effect, then, is due to the interference of the\\nground (or water) surface with the airflow patterns\\nabout the airplane in flight.\\nWhile the aerodynamic characteristics of the tail sur-\\nfaces and the fuselage are altered by ground effects,\\nthe principal effects due to proximity of the ground\\nare the changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of\\nthe wing. As the wing encounters ground effect and\\nis maintained at a constant lift coefficient, there is\\nconsequent reduction in the upwash, downwash, and\\nthe wingtip vortices.\\nInduced drag is a result of the wing’s work of sus-\\ntaining the airplane and the wing lifts the airplane\\nsimply by accelerating a mass of air downward. It\\nis true that reduced pressure on top of an airfoil is\\nessential to lift, but that is but one of the things\\nthat contributes to the overall effect of pushing an\\nair mass downward. The more downwash there is,\\nthe harder the wing is pushing the mass of air\\ndown. At high angles of attack, the amount of\\ninduced drag is high and since this corresponds to\\nlower airspeeds in actual flight, it can be said that\\ninduced drag predominates at low speed.\\nHowever, the reduction of the wingtip vortices due\\nto ground effect alters the spanwise lift distribution\\nand reduces the induced angle of attack and induced\\ndrag. Therefore, the wing will require a lower angle\\nof attack in ground effect to produce the same lift\\ncoefficient or, if a constant angle of attack is main-\\ntained, an increase in lift coefficient will result.\\n[Figure 3-8]\\nFigure 3-7.

Since induced drag predominates at low\\nspeeds, the reduction of induced drag due to ground\\neffect will cause the most significant reduction of\\nthrust required (parasite plus induced drag) at low\\nspeeds.\\nThe reduction in induced flow due to ground effect\\ncauses a significant reduction in induced drag but\\ncauses no direct effect on parasite drag. As a result\\nof the reduction in induced drag, the thrust required\\nat low speeds will be reduced.\\nDue to the change in upwash, downwash, and\\nwingtip vortices, there may be a change in position\\n(installation) error of the airspeed system, associated\\nwith ground effect. In the majority of cases, ground\\neffect will cause an increase in the local pressure at\\nthe static source and produce a lower indication of\\nairspeed and altitude. Thus, the airplane may be air-\\nborne at an indicated airspeed less than that normally\\nrequired.\\nIn order for ground effect to be of significant magni-\\ntude, the wing must be quite close to the ground. One\\nof the direct results of ground effect is the variation\\nof induced drag with wing height above the ground at\\na constant lift coefficient. When the wing is at a\\nheight equal to its span, the reduction in induced drag\\nis only 1.4 percent. However, when the wing is at a\\nheight equal to one-fourth its span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is 23.5 percent and, when the wing is at\\na height equal to one-tenth its span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is 47.6 percent. Thus, a large reduction\\nin induced drag will take place only when the wing is\\nvery close to the ground. Because of this variation,\\nground effect is most usually recognized during the\\nliftoff for takeoff or just prior to touchdown when\\nlanding.\\nDuring the takeoff phase of flight, ground effect pro-\\nduces some important relationships. The airplane\\nleaving ground effect after takeoff encounters just\\nthe reverse of the airplane entering ground effect\\nduring landing; i.e., the airplane leaving ground\\neffect will:\\n• Require an increase in angle of attack to maintain\\nthe same lift coefficient.\\n• Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust\\nrequired.\\n• Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up\\nchange in moment.\\n• Produce a reduction in static source pressure and\\nincrease in indicated airspeed.\\nThese general effects should point out the possible\\ndanger in attempting takeoff prior to achieving the\\nrecommended takeoff speed. Due to the reduced drag\\nin ground effect, the airplane may seem capable of\\ntakeoff well below the recommended speed.\\nHowever, as the airplane rises out of ground effect\\nwith a deficiency of speed, the greater induced drag\\nmay result in very marginal initial climb perform-\\nance. In the extreme conditions such as high gross\\nweight, high density altitude, and high temperature, a\\ndeficiency of airspeed during takeoff may permit the\\nairplane to become airborne but be incapable of flying\\nout of ground effect. In this case, the airplane may\\nbecome airborne initially with a deficiency of speed,\\nand then settle back to the runway. It is important that\\nno attempt be made to force the airplane to become\\nairborne with a deficiency of speed; the recommended\\ntakeoff speed is necessary to provide adequate initial\\nclimb performance. For this reason, it is imperative\\nthat a definite climb be established before retracting\\nthe landing gear or flaps.\\nDuring the landing phase of flight, the effect of prox-\\nimity to the ground also must be understood and\\nappreciated. If the airplane is brought into ground\\neffect with a constant angle of attack, the airplane\\nwill experience an increase in lift coefficient and a\\nreduction in the thrust required. Hence, a “floating”\\neffect may occur. Because of the reduced drag and\\npower off deceleration in ground effect, any excess\\nspeed at the point of flare may incur a considerable\\n“float” distance. As the airplane nears the point of\\ntouchdown, ground effect will be most realized at\\naltitudes less than the wingspan. During the final\\nphases of the approach as the airplane nears the\\nground, a reduced power setting is necessary or the\\nreduced thrust required would allow the airplane to\\nclimb above the desired glidepath.\\nAXES OF AN AIRPLANE\\nWhenever an airplane changes its flight attitude or\\nposition in flight, it rotates about one or more of\\nthree axes, which are imaginary lines that pass\\nthrough the airplane’s center of gravity. The axes of\\nan airplane can be considered as imaginary axles\\naround which the airplane turns, much like the axle\\naround which a wheel rotates. At the point where all\\nthree axes intersect, each is at a 90° angle to the other\\ntwo. The axis, which extends lengthwise through the\\nfuselage from the nose to the tail, is the longitudinal\\naxis. The axis, which extends crosswise from\\nwingtip to wingtip, is the lateral axis. The axis,\\nwhich passes vertically through the center of gravity,\\nis the vertical axis. [Figure 3-9]\\nThe airplane’s motion about its longitudinal axis\\nresembles the roll of a ship from side to side. In fact,\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-8'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-9\\nthe names used in describing the motion about an\\nairplane’s three axes were originally nautical terms.\\nThey have been adapted to aeronautical terminology\\nbecause of the similarity of motion between an air-\\nplane and the seagoing ship.\\nIn light of the adoption of nautical terms, the motion\\nabout the airplane’s longitudinal axis is called “roll”;\\nmotion about its lateral axis is referred to as “pitch.”\\nFinally, an airplane moves about its vertical axis in a\\nmotion, which is termed “yaw”—that is, a horizontal\\n(left and right) movement of the airplane’s nose.\\nThe three motions of the airplane (roll, pitch, and\\nyaw) are controlled by three control surfaces. Roll is\\ncontrolled by the ailerons; pitch is controlled by the\\nelevators; yaw is controlled by the rudder. The use of\\nthese controls is explained in Chapter 4—Flight\\nControls.\\nMOMENTS AND MOMENT ARM\\nA study of physics shows that a body that is free to\\nrotate will always turn about its center of gravity. In\\naerodynamic terms, the mathematical measure of an\\nairplane’s tendency to rotate about its center of\\ngravity is called a “moment.” A moment is said to be\\nequal to the product of the force applied and the dis-\\ntance at which the force is applied. (A moment arm is\\nthe distance from a datum [reference point or line] to\\nthe applied force.) For airplane weight and balance\\ncomputations, “moments” are expressed in terms of\\nthe distance of the arm times the airplane’s weight, or\\nsimply, inch pounds.\\nAirplane designers locate the fore and aft position of\\nthe airplane’s center of gravity as nearly as possible\\nto the 20 percent point of the mean aerodynamic\\nchord (MAC). If the thrust line is designed to pass\\nhorizontally through the center of gravity, it will not\\ncause the airplane to pitch when power is changed,\\nand there will be no difference in moment due to\\nthrust for a power-on or power-off condition of\\nflight. Although designers have some control over\\nthe location of the drag forces, they are not always\\nable to make the resultant drag forces pass through\\nthe center of gravity of the airplane. However, the\\none item over which they have the greatest control\\nis the size and location of the tail. The objective is\\nto make the moments (due to thrust, drag, and lift)\\nas small as possible; and, by proper location of the\\ntail, to provide the means of balancing the airplane\\nlongitudinally for any condition of flight.\\nThe pilot has no direct control over the location of\\nforces acting on the airplane in flight, except for\\ncontrolling the center of lift by changing the angle\\nof attack. Such a change, however, immediately\\ninvolves changes in other forces. Therefore, the\\npilot cannot independently change the location of\\none force without changing the effect of others. For\\nexample, a change in airspeed involves a change in\\nlift, as well as a change in drag and a change in the\\nup or down force on the tail. As forces such as tur-\\nbulence and gusts act to displace the airplane, the\\npilot reacts by providing opposing control forces to\\ncounteract this displacement.\\nSome airplanes are subject to changes in the location\\nof the center of gravity with variations of load.\\nTrimming devices are used to counteract the forces\\nset up by fuel burnoff, and loading or off-loading of\\npassengers or cargo. Elevator trim tabs and\\nadjustable horizontal stabilizers comprise the most\\ncommon devices provided to the pilot for trimming\\nfor load variations. Over the wide ranges of balance\\nduring flight in large airplanes, the force which the\\npilot has to exert on the controls would become\\nexcessive and fatiguing if means of trimming were\\nnot provided.\\nDESIGN CHARACTERISTICS\\nEvery pilot who has flown numerous types of air-\\nplanes has noted that each airplane handles somewhat\\ndifferently—that is, each resists or responds to\\ncontrol pressures in its own way.

These features can be designed into an air-\\nplane to facilitate the particular purpose the airplane\\nis to fulfill by considering certain stability and\\nmaneuvering requirements. In the following discus-\\nsion, it is intended to summarize the more important\\naspects of an airplane’s stability; its maneuvering\\nand controllability qualities; how they are analyzed;\\nand their relationship to various flight conditions. In\\nbrief, the basic differences between stability, maneu-\\nverability, and controllability are as follows:\\n• Stability —The inherent quality of an airplane\\nto correct for conditions that may disturb its\\nequilibrium, and to return or to continue on the\\noriginal flightpath. It is primarily an airplane\\ndesign characteristic.\\n• Maneuverability —The quality of an airplane\\nthat permits it to be maneuvered easily and to\\nwithstand the stresses imposed by maneuvers. It\\nis governed by the airplane’s weight, inertia, size\\nand location of flight controls, structural\\nstrength, and powerplant. It too is an airplane\\ndesign characteristic.\\n• Controllability —The capability of an airplane to\\nrespond to the pilot’s control, especially with\\nregard to flightpath and attitude. It is the quality\\nof the airplane’s response to the pilot’s control\\napplication when maneuvering the airplane,\\nregardless of its stability characteristics.\\nBASIC CONCEPTS OF STABILITY\\nThe flightpaths and attitudes in which an airplane\\ncan fly are limited only by the aerodynamic charac-\\nteristics of the airplane, its propulsive system, and its\\nstructural strength. These limitations indicate the\\nmaximum performance and maneuverability of the\\nairplane. If the airplane is to provide maximum util-\\nity, it must be safely controllable to the full extent of\\nthese limits without exceeding the pilot’s strength\\nor requiring exceptional flying ability. If an airplane\\nis to fly straight and steady along any arbitrary\\nflightpath, the forces acting on it must be in static\\nequilibrium. The reaction of any body when its\\nequilibrium is disturbed is referred to as stability.\\nThere are two types of stability; static and dynamic.\\nStatic will be discussed first, and in this discussion\\nthe following definitions will apply:\\n• Equilibrium —All opposing forces acting on the\\nairplane are balanced; (i.e., steady, unaccelerated\\nflight conditions).\\n• Static Stability —The initial tendency that the air-\\nplane displays after its equilibrium is disturbed.\\n• Positive Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to return to the original state of\\nequilibrium after being disturbed. [Figure 3-10]\\n• Negative Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to continue away from the original\\nstate of equilibrium after being disturbed. [Figure\\n3-10]\\n• Neutral Static Stability —The initial tendency\\nof the airplane to remain in a new condition after\\nits equilibrium has been disturbed. [Figure 3-10]\\nSTATIC STABILITY\\nStability of an airplane in flight is slightly more com-\\nplex than just explained, because the airplane is free\\nto move in any direction and must be controllable in\\nFigure 3-10.

When designing the airplane,\\nengineers must compromise between stability,\\nmaneuverability, and controllability; and the problem\\nis compounded because of the airplane’s three-axis\\nfreedom. Too much stability is detrimental to\\nmaneuverability, and similarly, not enough stabil-\\nity is detrimental to controllability. In the design\\nof airplanes, compromise between the two is the\\nkeyword.\\nDYNAMIC STABILITY\\nStatic stability has been defined as the initial tendency\\nthat the airplane displays after being disturbed from its\\ntrimmed condition. Occasionally, the initial tendency\\nis different or opposite from the overall tendency, so\\ndistinction must be made between the two. Dynamic\\nstability is the overall tendency that the airplane dis-\\nplays after its equilibrium is disturbed. The curves of\\nfigure 3-11 represent the variation of controlled\\nfunctions versus time. It is seen that the unit of time\\nis very significant. If the time unit for one cycle or\\noscillation is above 10 seconds’ duration, it is called\\na “long-period” oscillation (phugoid) and is easily\\ncontrolled. In a longitudinal phugoid oscillation,\\nthe angle of attack remains constant when the air-\\nspeed increases and decreases. To a certain degree,\\na convergent phugoid is desirable but is not\\nrequired. The phugoid can be determined only on a\\nstatically stable airplane, and this has a great effect\\non the trimming qualities of the airplane. If the\\ntime unit for one cycle or oscillation is less than\\none or two seconds, it is called a “short-period”\\noscillation and is normally very difficult, if not\\nimpossible, for the pilot to control. This is the type\\nof oscillation that the pilot can easily “get in phase\\nwith” and reinforce.\\nA neutral or divergent, short-period oscillation is\\ndangerous because structural failure usually\\nresults if the oscillation is not damped immedi-\\nately. Short-period oscillations affect airplane and\\ncontrol surfaces alike and reveal themselves as\\n“porpoising” in the airplane, or as in “buzz” or\\n“flutter” in the control surfaces. Basically, the\\nshort-period oscillation is a change in angle of\\nattack with no change in airspeed. A short-period\\noscillation of a control surface is usually of such\\nhigh frequency that the airplane does not have\\ntime to react. Logically, the Code of Federal\\nRegulations require that short-period oscillations\\nbe heavily damped (i.e., die out immediately).\\nFlight tests during the airworthiness certification\\nof airplanes are conducted for this condition by\\ninducing the oscillation in the controls for pitch,\\nroll, or yaw at the most critical speed (i.e., at V\\nNE,\\nthe never-exceed speed). The test pilot strikes the\\ncontrol wheel or rudder pedal a sharp blow and\\nobserves the results.\\nLONGITUDINAL STABILITY (PITCHING)\\nIn designing an airplane, a great deal of effort is\\nspent in developing the desired degree of stability\\naround all three axes.

It involves the\\npitching motion as the airplane’s nose moves up and\\ndown in flight. A longitudinally unstable airplane has\\na tendency to dive or climb progressively into a very\\nsteep dive or climb, or even a stall. Thus, an airplane\\nwith longitudinal instability becomes difficult and\\nsometimes dangerous to fly.\\nStatic longitudinal stability or instability in an air-\\nplane, is dependent upon three factors:\\n1. Location of the wing with respect to the center of\\ngravity;\\n2. Location of the horizontal tail surfaces with\\nrespect to the center of gravity; and\\n3. The area or size of the tail surfaces.\\nIn analyzing stability, it should be recalled that a\\nbody that is free to rotate will always turn about its\\ncenter of gravity.\\nTo obtain static longitudinal stability, the relation of\\nthe wing and tail moments must be such that, if the\\nmoments are initially balanced and the airplane is\\nsuddenly nosed up, the wing moments and tail\\nmoments will change so that the sum of their forces\\nwill provide an unbalanced but restoring moment\\nwhich, in turn, will bring the nose down again.\\nSimilarly, if the airplane is nosed down, the resulting\\nchange in moments will bring the nose back up.\\nThe center of lift, sometimes called the center of\\npressure, in most unsymmetrical airfoils has a ten-\\ndency to change its fore and aft position with a\\nchange in the angle of attack. The center of pressure\\ntends to move forward with an increase in angle of\\nattack and to move aft with a decrease in angle of\\nattack. This means that when the angle of attack of\\nan airfoil is increased, the center of pressure (lift) by\\nmoving forward, tends to lift the leading edge of the\\nwing still more. This tendency gives the wing an\\ninherent quality of instability.\\nFigure 3-12 shows an airplane in straight-and-level\\nflight. The line CG-CL-T represents the airplane’s\\nlongitudinal axis from the center of gravity (CG) to\\na point T on the horizontal stabilizer. The center of\\nlift (or center of pressure) is represented by the\\npoint CL.\\nMost airplanes are designed so that the wing’s center\\nof lift (CL) is to the rear of the center of gravity. This\\nmakes the airplane “nose heavy” and requires that\\nthere be a slight downward force on the horizontal\\nstabilizer in order to balance the airplane and keep\\nthe nose from continually pitching downward.\\nCompensation for this nose heaviness is provided\\nby setting the horizontal stabilizer at a slight neg-\\native angle of attack. The downward force thus\\nproduced, holds the tail down, counterbalancing\\nthe “heavy” nose. It is as if the line CG-CL-T was\\na lever with an upward force at CL and two down-\\nward forces balancing each other, one a strong\\nforce at the CG point and the other, a much lesser\\nforce, at point T (downward air pressure on the\\nstabilizer). Applying simple physics principles, it\\ncan be seen that if an iron bar were suspended at\\npoint CL with a heavy weight hanging on it at the\\nCG, it would take some downward pressure at\\npoint T to keep the “lever” in balance.\\nEven though the horizontal stabilizer may be level\\nwhen the airplane is in level flight, there is a\\ndownwash of air from the wings. This downwash\\nstrikes the top of the stabilizer and produces a\\ndownward pressure, which at a certain speed will\\nbe just enough to balance the “lever.” The faster\\nthe airplane is flying, the greater this downwash\\nand the greater the downward force on the horizontal\\nstabilizer (except “T” tails). [Figure 3-13] In air-\\nplanes with fixed position horizontal stabilizers, the\\nairplane manufacturer sets the stabilizer at an angle\\nthat will provide the best stability (or balance)\\nduring flight at the design cruising speed and\\npower setting. [Figure 3-14]\\nIf the airplane’s speed decreases, the speed of the air-\\nflow over the wing is decreased. As a result of this\\ndecreased flow of air over the wing, the downwash\\nis reduced, causing a lesser downward force on the\\nhorizontal stabilizer. In turn, the characteristic nose\\nheaviness is accentuated, causing the airplane’s nose\\nto pitch down more. This places the airplane in a\\nnose-low attitude, lessening the wing’s angle of\\nattack and drag and allowing the airspeed to\\nincrease. As the airplane continues in the nose-low\\nattitude and its speed increases, the downward force\\non the horizontal stabilizer is once again increased.\\nCL\\nCG\\nCLCG\\nT\\nT\\nFigure 3-12.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-13\\nConsequently, the tail is again pushed downward and\\nthe nose rises into a climbing attitude.\\nAs this climb continues, the airspeed again decreases,\\ncausing the downward force on the tail to decrease\\nuntil the nose lowers once more. However, because\\nthe airplane is dynamically stable, the nose does not\\nlower as far this time as it did before. The airplane\\nwill acquire enough speed in this more gradual dive\\nto start it into another climb, but the climb is not so\\nsteep as the preceding one.\\nAfter several of these diminishing oscillations, in\\nwhich the nose alternately rises and lowers, the air-\\nplane will finally settle down to a speed at which\\nthe downward force on the tail exactly counteracts\\nthe tendency of the airplane to dive. When this\\ncondition is attained, the airplane will once again\\nbe in balanced flight and will continue in stabi-\\nlized flight as long as this attitude and airspeed are\\nnot changed.\\nA similar effect will be noted upon closing the\\nthrottle. The downwash of the wings is reduced\\nand the force at T in figure 3-12 is not enough to\\nhold the horizontal stabilizer down. It is as if the\\nforce at T on the lever were allowing the force of\\ngravity to pull the nose down. This, of course, is a\\ndesirable characteristic because the airplane is\\ninherently trying to regain airspeed and reestablish\\nthe proper balance.\\nPower or thrust can also have a destabilizing effect\\nin that an increase of power may tend to make the\\nnose rise. The airplane designer can offset this by\\nestablishing a “high thrustline” wherein the line of\\nthrust passes above the center of gravity. [Figures\\n3-15 and 3-16] In this case, as power or thrust is\\nincreased a moment is produced to counteract the\\ndown load on the tail. On the other hand, a very\\n“low thrust line” would tend to add to the nose-up\\neffect of the horizontal tail surface.\\nFigure 3-15. Thrust line affects longitudinal stability.\\nIt can be concluded, then, that with the center of gravity\\nforward of the center of lift, and with an aerodynamic\\ntail-down force, the result is that the airplane always\\ntries to return to a safe flying attitude.\\nA simple demonstration of longitudinal stability may\\nbe made as follows: Trim the airplane for “hands off”\\ncontrol in level flight.

Ordinarily, the nose will pass the original\\nposition (that of level flight) and a series of slow\\npitching oscillations will follow. If the oscillations\\ngradually cease, the airplane has positive stability;\\nif they continue unevenly, the airplane has neutral\\nstability; if they increase, the airplane is unstable.\\nLATERAL STABILITY (ROLLING)\\nStability about the airplane’s longitudinal axis,\\nwhich extends from nose to tail, is called lateral\\nstability. This helps to stabilize the lateral or\\nrolling effect when one wing gets lower than the\\nwing on the opposite side of the airplane. There are\\nfour main design factors that make an airplane sta-\\nble laterally: dihedral, keel effect, sweepback, and\\nweight distribution.\\nThe most common procedure for producing lateral\\nstability is to build the wings with a dihedral angle\\nvarying from one to three degrees. In other words, the\\nwings on either side of the airplane join the fuselage\\nto form a slight V or angle called “dihedral,” and this\\nis measured by the angle made by each wing above a\\nline parallel to the lateral axis.\\nThe basis of rolling stability is, of course, the lat-\\neral balance of forces produced by the airplane’s\\nwings. Any imbalance in lift results in a tendency\\nfor the airplane to roll about its longitudinal axis.\\nStated another way, dihedral involves a balance of\\nlift created by the wings’ angle of attack on each\\nside of the airplane’s longitudinal axis.\\nIf a momentary gust of wind forces one wing of the\\nairplane to rise and the other to lower, the airplane\\nwill bank. When the airplane is banked without turn-\\ning, it tends to sideslip or slide downward toward the\\nlowered wing. [Figure 3-17] Since the wings have\\ndihedral, the air strikes the low wing at much greater\\nangle of attack than the high wing. This increases the\\nlift on the low wing and decreases lift on the high\\nwing, and tends to restore the airplane to its original\\nlateral attitude (wings level)—that is, the angle of\\nattack and lift on the two wings are again equal.\\nFigure 3-17. Dihedral for lateral stability.\\nThe effect of dihedral, then, is to produce a rolling\\nmoment tending to return the airplane to a laterally\\nbalanced flight condition when a sideslip occurs.\\nThe restoring force may move the low wing up too\\nfar, so that the opposite wing now goes down. If so,\\nthe process will be repeated, decreasing with each\\nlateral oscillation until a balance for wings-level\\nflight is finally reached.\\nConversely, excessive dihedral has an adverse effect\\non lateral maneuvering qualities. The airplane may be\\nso stable laterally that it resists any intentional rolling\\nmotion. For this reason, airplanes that require fast roll\\nor banking characteristics usually have less dihedral\\nthan those designed for less maneuverability.\\nThe contribution of sweepback to dihedral effect is\\nimportant because of the nature of the contribution.\\nIn a sideslip, the wing into the wind is operating with\\nan effective decrease in sweepback, while the wing\\nout of the wind is operating with an effective increase\\nin sweepback. The swept wing is responsive only to\\nthe wind component that is perpendicular to the\\nwing’s leading edge. Consequently, if the wing is\\nT\\nL\\nCG\\nCruise Power\\nL\\nCGT\\nIdle Power\\nL\\nCG\\nT\\nFull Power\\nFigure 3-16.

In this manner, the\\nswept back wing would contribute a positive dihedral\\neffect and the swept forward wing would contribute a\\nnegative dihedral effect.\\nDuring flight, the side area of the airplane’s fuselage\\nand vertical fin react to the airflow in much the same\\nmanner as the keel of a ship. That is, it exerts a\\nsteadying influence on the airplane laterally about\\nthe longitudinal axis.\\nSuch laterally stable airplanes are constructed so that\\nthe greater portion of the keel area is above and\\nbehind the center of gravity. [Figure 3-18] Thus,\\nwhen the airplane slips to one side, the combination\\nof the airplane’s weight and the pressure of the air-\\nflow against the upper portion of the keel area (both\\nacting about the CG) tends to roll the airplane back\\nto wings-level flight.\\nFigure 3-18. Keel area for lateral stability.\\nVERTICAL STABILITY (YAWING)\\nStability about the airplane’s vertical axis (the side-\\nways moment) is called yawing or directional stability.\\nYawing or directional stability is the more easily\\nachieved stability in airplane design. The area of the\\nvertical fin and the sides of the fuselage aft of the\\ncenter of gravity are the prime contributors which\\nmake the airplane act like the well known weather-\\nvane or arrow, pointing its nose into the relative\\nwind.\\nIn examining a weathervane, it can be seen that if\\nexactly the same amount of surface were exposed\\nto the wind in front of the pivot point as behind it,\\nthe forces fore and aft would be in balance and\\nlittle or no directional movement would result.\\nConsequently, it is necessary to have a greater\\nsurface aft of the pivot point that forward of it.\\nSimilarly in an airplane, the designer must ensure\\npositive directional stability by making the side\\nsurface greater aft than ahead of the center of\\ngravity. [Figure 3-19] To provide more positive\\nstability aside from that provided by the fuselage,\\na vertical fin is added. The fin acts similar to the\\nfeather on an arrow in maintaining straight flight.\\nLike the weathervane and the arrow, the farther aft\\nthis fin is placed and the larger its size, the greater\\nthe airplane’s directional stability.\\nFigure 3-19. Fuselage and fin for vertical stability.\\nIf an airplane is flying in a straight line, and a side-\\nward gust of air gives the airplane a slight rotation\\nabout its vertical axis (i.e., the right), the motion is\\nretarded and stopped by the fin because while the\\nairplane is rotating to the right, the air is striking the\\nleft side of the fin at an angle. This causes pressure\\non the left side of the fin, which resists the turning\\nmotion and slows down the airplane’s yaw. In doing\\nso, it acts somewhat like the weathervane by turning\\nthe airplane into the relative wind. The initial change\\nin direction of the airplane’s flightpath is generally\\nslightly behind its change of heading. Therefore,\\nafter a slight yawing of the airplane to the right, there\\nis a brief moment when the airplane is still moving\\nalong its original path, but its longitudinal axis is\\npointed slightly to the right.\\nThe airplane is then momentarily skidding sideways,\\nand during that moment (since it is assumed that\\nalthough the yawing motion has stopped, the excess\\npressure on the left side of the fin still persists) there\\nCG\\nCG\\nCenterline\\nCenterline\\nCG\\nArea\\nForward\\nof CG\\nArea AFT\\nof CG\\nCG\\nRelative Wind Yaw\\nYaw\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-15'),\n",

That is, there is a momen-\\ntary restoring tendency caused by the fin.\\nThis restoring tendency is relatively slow in develop-\\ning and ceases when the airplane stops skidding. When\\nit ceases, the airplane will be flying in a direction\\nslightly different from the original direction. In\\nother words, it will not of its own accord return to\\nthe original heading; the pilot must reestablish the\\ninitial heading.\\nA minor improvement of directional stability may\\nbe obtained through sweepback. Sweepback is incor-\\nporated in the design of the wing primarily to delay\\nthe onset of compressibility during high-speed flight.\\nIn lighter and slower airplanes, sweepback aids\\nin locating the center of pressure in the correct\\nrelationship with the center of gravity. A longitudinally\\nstable airplane is built with the center of pressure aft of\\nthe center of gravity.\\nBecause of structural reasons, airplane designers\\nsometimes cannot attach the wings to the fuselage at\\nthe exact desired point. If they had to mount the\\nwings too far forward, and at right angles to the\\nfuselage, the center of pressure would not be far\\nenough to the rear to result in the desired amount of\\nlongitudinal stability. By building sweepback into\\nthe wings, however, the designers can move the cen-\\nter of pressure toward the rear. The amount of\\nsweepback and the position of the wings then place\\nthe center of pressure in the correct location.\\nThe contribution of the wing to static directional sta-\\nbility is usually small. The swept wing provides a\\nstable contribution depending on the amount of\\nsweepback, but the contribution is relatively small\\nwhen compared with other components.\\nFREE DIRECTIONAL \\nOSCILLATIONS (DUTCH ROLL)\\nDutch Roll is a coupled lateral/directional oscillation\\nthat is usually dynamically stable but is objectionable\\nin an airplane because of the oscillatory nature. The\\ndamping of the oscillatory mode may be weak or\\nstrong depending on the properties of the particular\\nairplane.\\nUnfortunately all air is not smooth. There are bumps\\nand depressions created by gusty updrafts and down-\\ndrafts, and by gusts from ahead, behind, or the side\\nof the airplane.\\nThe response of the airplane to a disturbance from\\nequilibrium is a combined rolling/yawing oscillation\\nin which the rolling motion is phased to precede\\nthe yawing motion. The yawing motion is not too\\nsignificant, but the roll is much more noticeable.\\nWhen the airplane rolls back toward level flight in\\nresponse to dihedral effect, it rolls back too far\\nand sideslips the other way. Thus, the airplane\\novershoots each time because of the strong dihe-\\ndral effect. When the dihedral effect is large in\\ncomparison with static directional stability, the\\nDutch Roll motion has weak damping and is\\nobjectionable. When the static directional stability\\nis strong in comparison with the dihedral effect,\\nthe Dutch Roll motion has such heavy damping\\nthat it is not objectionable. However, these qualities\\ntend toward spiral instability.\\nThe choice is then the least of two evils—Dutch Roll\\nis objectionable and spiral instability is tolerable if\\nthe rate of divergence is low. Since the more\\nimportant handling qualities are a result of high\\nstatic directional stability and minimum necessary\\ndihedral effect, most airplanes demonstrate a mild\\nspiral tendency. This tendency would be indicated\\nto the pilot by the fact that the airplane cannot be\\nflown “hands off” indefinitely.\\nIn most modern airplanes, except high-speed\\nswept wing designs, these free directional oscilla-\\ntions usually die out automatically in a very few\\ncycles unless the air continues to be gusty or\\nturbulent. Those airplanes with continuing Dutch\\nRoll tendencies usually are equipped with gyro\\nstabilized yaw dampers. An airplane that has\\nDutch Roll tendencies is disconcerting, to say the\\nleast. Therefore, the manufacturer tries to reach a\\nmedium between too much and too little direc-\\ntional stability. Because it is more desirable for\\nthe airplane to have “spiral instability” than Dutch\\nRoll tendencies, most airplanes are designed with\\nthat characteristic.\\nSPIRAL INSTABILITY\\nSpiral instability exists when the static directional\\nstability of the airplane is very strong as compared\\nto the effect of its dihedral in maintaining lateral\\nequilibrium. When the lateral equilibrium of the\\nairplane is disturbed by a gust of air and a sideslip\\nis introduced, the strong directional stability tends\\nto yaw the nose into the resultant relative wind\\nwhile the comparatively weak dihedral lags in\\nrestoring the lateral balance. Due to this yaw, the\\nwing on the outside of the turning moment travels\\nforward faster than the inside wing and as a conse-\\nquence, its lift becomes greater. This produces an\\noverbanking tendency which, if not corrected by\\nthe pilot, will result in the bank angle becoming\\nsteeper and steeper. At the same time, the strong\\ndirectional stability that yaws the airplane into the\\nrelative wind is actually forcing the nose to a lower\\npitch attitude. Then, the start of a slow downward\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-16'),\n",

This tendency would\\nbe indicated to the pilot by the fact that the airplane\\ncannot be flown “hands off” indefinitely.\\nMuch study and effort has gone into development\\nof control devices (wing leveler) to eliminate or at\\nleast correct this instability. Advanced stages of\\nthis spiral condition demand that the pilot be very\\ncareful in application of recovery controls, or\\nexcessive loads on the structure may be imposed.\\nOf the in-flight structural failures that have\\noccurred in general aviation airplanes, improper\\nrecovery from this condition has probably been\\nthe underlying cause of more fatalities than any\\nother single factor. The reason is that the airspeed\\nin the spiral condition builds up rapidly, and the\\napplication of back elevator force to reduce this\\nspeed and to pull the nose up only “tightens the\\nturn,” increasing the load factor. The results of the\\nprolonged uncontrolled spiral are always the\\nsame; either in-flight structural failure, crashing\\ninto the ground, or both. The most common causes\\non record for getting into this situation are: loss of\\nhorizon reference, inability of the pilot to control\\nthe airplane by reference to instruments, or a com-\\nbination of both. \\nAERODYNAMIC FORCES \\nIN FLIGHT MANEUVERS\\nFORCES IN\\nTURNS\\nIf an airplane\\nwere viewed in\\ns t r a i g h t - a n d -\\nlevel flight from\\nthe rear [figure\\n3-20], and if the\\nforces acting on\\nthe airplane actu-\\nally could be\\nseen, two forces\\n(lift and weight)\\nwould be apparent, and if the airplane were in a bank it\\nwould be apparent that lift did not act directly opposite\\nto the weight—it now acts in the direction of the bank.\\nThe fact that when the airplane banks, lift acts inward\\ntoward the center of the turn, as well as upward, is one\\nof the basic truths to remember in the consideration of\\nturns.\\nAn object at rest or moving in a straight line will\\nremain at rest or continue to move in a straight line\\nuntil acted on by some other force. An airplane, like\\nany moving object, requires a sideward force to\\nmake it turn. In a normal turn, this force is supplied\\nby banking the airplane so that lift is exerted inward\\nas well as upward. The force of lift during a turn is\\nseparated into two components at right angles to\\neach other. One component, which acts vertically\\nand opposite to the weight (gravity), is called the\\n“vertical component of lift.” The other, which acts\\nhorizontally toward the center of the turn, is called\\nthe “horizontal component of lift,” or centripetal\\nforce. The horizontal component of lift is the force\\nthat pulls the airplane from a straight flightpath to\\nmake it turn. Centrifugal force is the “equal and\\nopposite reaction” of the airplane to the change in\\ndirection and acts equal and opposite to the hori-\\nzontal component of lift. This explains why, in a\\ncorrectly executed turn, the force that turns the\\nairplane is not supplied by the rudder.\\nAn airplane is not steered like a boat or an automo-\\nbile; in order for it to turn, it must be banked. If the\\nairplane is not banked, there is no force available that\\nwill cause it to deviate from a straight flightpath.\\nConversely, when an airplane is banked, it will turn,\\nprovided it is not slipping to the inside of the turn.\\nGood directional control is based on the fact that the\\nairplane will attempt to turn whenever it is banked.\\nCentripetal Force – The force opposite centrifugal force and attracts a\\nbody towards its axis of rotation. \\nCentrifugal Force—An apparent force resulting from the effect of iner-\\ntia during a turn.\\nFigure 3-20.

This division reduces the amount of\\nlift which is opposing gravity and actually support-\\ning the airplane’s weight; consequently, the airplane\\nloses altitude unless additional lift is created. This is\\ndone by increasing the angle of attack until the verti-\\ncal component of lift is again equal to the weight.\\nSince the vertical component of lift decreases as the\\nbank angle increases, the angle of attack must be\\nprogressively increased to produce sufficient verti-\\ncal lift to support the airplane’s weight. The fact that\\nthe vertical component of lift must be equal to the\\nweight to maintain altitude is an important fact to\\nremember when making constant altitude turns.\\nAt a given airspeed, the rate at which an airplane\\nturns depends upon the magnitude of the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift. It will be found that the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift is proportional to the angle of\\nbank—that is, it increases or decreases respectively\\nas the angle of bank increases or decreases. It logi-\\ncally follows then, that as the angle of bank is\\nincreased the horizontal component of lift increases,\\nthereby increasing the rate of turn. Consequently, at\\nany given airspeed the rate of turn can be controlled\\nby adjusting the angle of bank.\\nTo provide a vertical component of lift sufficient to\\nhold altitude in a level turn, an increase in the angle\\nof attack is required. Since the drag of the airfoil is\\ndirectly proportional to its angle of attack, induced\\ndrag will increase as the lift is increased. This, in\\nturn, causes a loss of airspeed in proportion to the\\nangle of bank; a small angle of bank results in a\\nsmall reduction in airspeed and a large angle of\\nbank results in a large reduction in airspeed.\\nAdditional thrust (power) must be applied to pre-\\nvent a reduction in airspeed in level turns; the\\nrequired amount of additional thrust is proportional\\nto the angle of bank.\\nTo compensate for added lift, which would result if\\nthe airspeed were increased during a turn, the angle\\nof attack must be decreased, or the angle of bank\\nincreased, if a constant altitude were to be main-\\ntained. If the angle of bank were held constant and\\nthe angle of attack decreased, the rate of turn would\\ndecrease. Therefore, in order to maintain a constant\\nrate of turn as the airspeed is increased, the angle of\\nattack must remain constant and the angle of bank\\nincreased.\\nIt must be remembered that an increase in airspeed\\nresults in an increase of the turn radius and that cen-\\ntrifugal force is directly proportional to the radius of\\nthe turn. In a correctly executed turn, the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift must be exactly equal and opposite\\nto the centrifugal force. Therefore, as the airspeed is\\nincreased in a constant rate level turn, the radius of\\nthe turn increases. This increase in the radius of turn\\ncauses an increase in the centrifugal force, which\\nmust be balanced by an increase in the horizontal\\ncomponent of lift, which can only be increased by\\nincreasing the angle of bank.\\nIn a slipping turn, the airplane is not turning at the\\nrate appropriate to the bank being used, since the air-\\nplane is yawed toward the outside of the turning\\nflightpath. The airplane is banked too much for the\\nrate of turn, so the horizontal lift component is\\ngreater than the centrifugal force. [Figure 3-21]\\nEquilibrium between the horizontal lift component\\nand centrifugal force is reestablished either by\\nFigure 3-21.

The rate of\\nturn is too great for the angle of bank. Correction of\\na skidding turn thus involves a reduction in the rate\\nof turn, an increase in bank, or a combination of the\\ntwo changes.\\nTo maintain a given rate of turn, the angle of bank\\nmust be varied with the airspeed. This becomes par-\\nticularly important in high-speed airplanes. For\\ninstance, at 400 miles per hour (m.p.h.), an airplane\\nmust be banked approximately 44° to execute a\\nstandard rate turn (3° per second). At this angle of\\nbank, only about 79 percent of the lift of the airplane\\ncomprises the vertical component of the lift; the\\nresult is a loss of altitude unless the angle of attack\\nis increased sufficiently to compensate for the loss\\nof vertical lift.\\nFORCES IN CLIMBS\\nFor all practical purposes, the wing’s lift in a\\nsteady state normal climb is the same as it is in a\\nsteady level flight at the same airspeed. Though the\\nairplane’s flightpath has changed when the climb\\nhas been established, the angle of attack of the\\nwing with respect to the inclined flightpath reverts\\nto practically the same values, as does the lift.\\nThere is an initial momentary change, however, as\\nshown in figure 3-22. During the transition from\\nstraight-and-level flight to a climb, a change in lift\\noccurs when back elevator pressure is first applied.\\nRaising the airplane’s nose increases the angle of\\nattack and momentarily increases the lift. Lift at\\nthis moment is now greater than weight and starts\\nthe airplane climbing. After the flightpath is stabi-\\nlized on the upward incline, the angle of attack and\\nlift again revert to about the level flight values.\\nIf the climb is entered with no change in power set-\\nting, the airspeed gradually diminishes because the\\nthrust required to maintain a given airspeed in level\\nflight is insufficient to maintain the same airspeed\\nin a climb. When the flightpath is inclined upward,\\na component of the airplane’s weight acts in the\\nsame direction as, and parallel to, the total drag of\\nthe airplane, thereby increasing the total effective\\ndrag. Consequently, the total drag is greater than the\\npower, and the airspeed decreases. The reduction in\\nairspeed gradually results in a corresponding\\ndecrease in drag until the total drag (including the\\ncomponent of weight acting in the same direction)\\nequals the thrust. [Figure 3-23] Due to momentum,\\nthe change in airspeed is gradual, varying consider-\\nably with differences in airplane size, weight, total\\ndrag, and other factors.\\nFigure 3-23. Changes in speed during climb entry.\\nGenerally, the forces of thrust and drag, and lift\\nand weight, again become balanced when the air-\\nspeed stabilizes but at a value lower than in\\nstraight-and-level flight at the same power setting.\\nSince in a climb the airplane’s weight is not only\\nacting downward but rearward along with drag,\\nadditional power is required to maintain the same\\nairspeed as in level flight. The amount of power\\ndepends on the angle of climb. When the climb is\\nestablished so steep that there is insufficient power\\navailable, a slower speed results. It will be seen\\nthen that the amount of reserve power determines\\nthe climb performance of the airplane.\\nFORCES IN DESCENTS\\nAs in climbs, the forces acting on the airplane go\\nthrough definite changes when a descent is entered\\nfrom straight-and-level flight. The analysis here is\\nthat of descending at the same power as used in\\nstraight-and-level flight.\\nWhen forward pressure is applied to the elevator\\ncontrol to start descending, or the airplane’s nose is\\nallowed to pitch down, the angle of attack is\\ndecreased and, as a result, the lift of the airfoil is\\nreduced. This reduction in total lift and angle of\\nattack is momentary and occurs during the time the\\nL\\nSteady Climb\\nNormal Lift\\nL\\nClimb Entry\\nIncreased Lift\\nL\\nLevel Flight\\nNormal Lift\\nFigure 3-22.

The change to a\\ndownward flightpath is due to the lift momentarily\\nbecoming less than the weight of the airplane as the\\nangle of attack is reduced. This imbalance between\\nlift and weight causes the airplane to follow a\\ndescending flightpath with respect to the horizontal\\nflightpath of straight-and-level flight. When the\\nflightpath is in a steady descent, the airfoil’s angle\\nof attack again approaches the original value, and\\nlift and weight will again become stabilized. From\\nthe time the descent is started until it is stabilized,\\nthe airspeed will gradually increase. This is due to a\\ncomponent of weight now acting forward along the\\nflightpath, similar to the manner it acted rearward\\nin a climb. The overall effect is that of increased\\npower or thrust, which in turn causes the increase\\nin airspeed associated with descending at the same\\npower as used in level flight.\\nTo descend at the same airspeed as used in straight-\\nand-level flight, obviously, the power must be reduced\\nas the descent is entered. The component of weight\\nacting forward along the flightpath will increase as\\nthe angle of rate of descent increases and conversely,\\nwill decrease as the angle of rate of descent\\ndecreases. Therefore, the amount of power reduction\\nrequired for a descent at the same speed as cruise\\nwill be determined by the steepness of the descent.\\nSTALLS\\nAn airplane will fly as long as the wing is creating\\nsufficient lift to counteract the load imposed on it.\\nWhen the lift is completely lost, the airplane stalls.\\nRemember, the direct cause of every stall is an\\nexcessive angle of attack. There are any number of\\nflight maneuvers which may produce an increase in\\nthe angle of attack, but the stall does not occur until\\nthe angle of attack becomes excessive.\\nIt must be emphasized that the stalling speed of a\\nparticular airplane is not a fixed value for all flight\\nsituations. However, a given airplane will always\\nstall at the same angle of attack regardless of air-\\nspeed, weight, load factor, or density altitude. Each\\nairplane has a particular angle of attack where the\\nairflow separates from the upper surface of the wing\\nand the stall occurs. This critical angle of attack\\nvaries from 16° to 20° depending on the airplane’s\\ndesign. But each airplane has only one specific angle\\nof attack where the stall occurs.\\nThere are three situations in which the critical angle\\nof attack can be exceeded: in low-speed flying, in\\nhigh-speed flying, and in turning flight.\\nThe airplane can be stalled in straight-and-level\\nflight by flying too slowly. As the airspeed is being\\ndecreased, the angle of attack must be increased to\\nretain the lift required for maintaining altitude. The\\nslower the airspeed becomes, the more the angle of\\nattack must be increased. Eventually, an angle of\\nattack is reached which will result in the wing not\\nproducing enough lift to support the airplane and it\\nwill start settling. If the airspeed is reduced further,\\nthe airplane will stall, since the angle of attack has\\nexceeded the critical angle and the airflow over the\\nwing is disrupted.\\nIt must be reemphasized here that low speed is not\\nnecessary to produce a stall. The wing can be\\nbrought into an excessive angle of attack at any\\nspeed. For example, take the case of an airplane\\nwhich is in a dive with an airspeed of 200 knots\\nwhen suddenly the pilot pulls back sharply on the\\nelevator control. [Figure 3-24] Because of gravity\\nand centrifugal force, the airplane could not immedi-\\nately alter its flightpath but would merely change its\\nangle of attack abruptly from quite low to very high.\\nSince the flightpath of the airplane in relation to the\\noncoming air determines the direction of the relative\\nwind, the angle of attack is suddenly increased, and\\nthe airplane would quickly reach the stalling angle at\\na speed much greater than the normal stall speed.\\nFigure 3-24. Forces exerted when pulling out of a dive.\\nSimilarly, the stalling speed of an airplane is higher\\nin a level turn than in straight-and-level flight.\\n[Figure 3-25] This is because centrifugal force is\\nadded to the airplane’s weight, and the wing must\\nproduce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance\\nthe load imposed by the combination of centrifugal\\nforce and weight. In a turn, the necessary additional\\nlift is acquired by applying back pressure to the ele-\\nvator control. This increases the wing’s angle of\\nattack, and results in increased lift. The angle of\\nattack must increase as the bank angle increases to\\ncounteract the increasing load caused by centrifugal\\nforce. If at any time during a turn the angle of attack\\nbecomes excessive, the airplane will stall.\\nL\\nCF\\nW\\nL\\nL\\nCF\\nCF CF\\nW\\nW\\nW\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-20'),\n",

To balance the airplane\\naerodynamically, the center of lift is normally\\nlocated aft of the center of gravity. Although this\\nmakes the airplane inherently “nose heavy,”\\ndownwash on the horizontal stabilizer counteracts\\nthis condition. It can be seen then, that at the point\\nof stall when the upward force of the wing’s lift\\nand the downward tail force cease, an unbalanced\\ncondition exists. This allows the airplane to pitch\\ndown abruptly, rotating about its center of gravity.\\nDuring this nose-down attitude, the angle of attack\\ndecreases and the airspeed again increases; hence,\\nthe smooth flow of air over the wing begins again,\\nlift returns, and the airplane is again flying.\\nHowever, considerable altitude may be lost before\\nthis cycle is complete.\\nBASIC PROPELLER PRINCIPLES\\nThe airplane propeller consists of two or more blades\\nand a central hub to which the blades are attached.\\nEach blade of an airplane propeller is essentially a\\nrotating wing. As a result of their construction, the\\npropeller blades are like airfoils and produce forces\\nthat create the thrust to pull, or push, the airplane\\nthrough the air.\\nThe power needed to rotate the propeller blades is\\nfurnished by the engine. The engine rotates the air-\\nfoils of the blades through the air at high speeds, and\\nthe propeller transforms the rotary power of the\\nengine into forward thrust.\\nAn airplane moving through the air creates a drag\\nforce opposing its forward motion. Consequently, if\\nan airplane is to fly, there must be a force applied to\\nit that is equal to the drag, but acting forward. This\\nforce is called “thrust.”\\nA cross section of a typical propeller blade is shown\\nin figure 3-26. This section or blade element is an\\nairfoil comparable to a cross section of an airplane\\nwing. One surface of the blade is cambered or\\ncurved, similar to the upper surface of an airplane\\nwing, while the other surface is flat like the bottom\\nsurface of a wing. The chord line is an imaginary\\nline drawn through the blade from its leading edge\\nto its trailing edge. As in a wing, the leading edge is\\nthe thick edge of the blade that meets the air as the\\npropeller rotates.\\nFigure 3-26. Airfoil sections of propeller blade.\\nBlade angle, usually measured in degrees, is the\\nangle between the chord of the blade and the plane\\nof rotation [figure 3-27] and is measured at a spe-\\ncific point along the length of the blade. Because\\nmost propellers have a flat blade “face,” the chord\\nline is often drawn along the face of the propeller\\nblade. Pitch is not the same as blade angle, but\\nbecause pitch is largely determined by blade angle,\\nthe two terms are often used interchangeably. An\\nincrease or decrease in one is usually associated with\\nan increase or decrease in the other.\\nFigure 3-27. Propeller blade angle.\\nThe pitch of a propeller may be designated in\\ninches. A propeller designated as a “74-48” would\\nbe 74 inches in length and have an effective pitch\\nof 48 inches. The pitch in inches is the distance\\nwhich the propeller would screw through the air in\\none revolution if there were no slippage.\\nFigure 3-25.

In this situation, each\\npropeller blade is turning through the air at an angle\\nof attack that produces relatively little thrust for the\\namount of power required to turn it.\\nTo understand the action of a propeller, consider first\\nits motion, which is both rotational and forward.\\nThus, as shown by the vectors of propeller forces in\\nfigure 3-27, each section of a propeller blade moves\\ndownward and forward. The angle at which this air\\n(relative wind) strikes the propeller blade is its angle\\nof attack. The air deflection produced by this angle\\ncauses the dynamic pressure at the engine side of the\\npropeller blade to be greater than atmospheric, thus\\ncreating thrust.\\nThe shape of the blade also creates thrust, because\\nit is cambered like the airfoil shape of a wing.\\nConsequently, as the air flows past the propeller, the\\npressure on one side is less than that on the other. As in\\na wing, this produces a reaction force in the direction\\nof the lesser pressure. In the case of a wing, the airflow\\nover the wing has less pressure, and the force (lift) is\\nupward. In the case of the propeller, which is mounted\\nin a vertical instead of a horizontal plane, the area\\nof decreased pressure is in front of the propeller,\\nand the force (thrust) is in a forward direction.\\nAerodynamically, then, thrust is the result of the\\npropeller shape and the angle of attack of the blade.\\nAnother way to consider thrust is in terms of the\\nmass of air handled by the propeller. In these\\nterms, thrust is equal to the mass of air handled,\\ntimes the slipstream velocity, minus the velocity\\nof the airplane. The power expended in producing\\nthrust depends on the rate of air mass movement.\\nOn the average, thrust constitutes approximately\\n80 percent of the torque (total horsepower\\nabsorbed by the propeller). The other 20 percent is\\nlost in friction and slippage. For any speed of rota-\\ntion, the horsepower absorbed by the propeller\\nbalances the horsepower delivered by the engine.\\nFor any single revolution of the propeller, the\\namount of air handled depends on the blade angle,\\nwhich determines how big a “bite” of air the pro-\\npeller takes. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent\\nmeans of adjusting the load on the propeller to\\ncontrol the engine r.p.m.\\nThe blade angle is also an excellent method of\\nadjusting the angle of attack of the propeller. On con-\\nstant-speed propellers, the blade angle must be\\nadjusted to provide the most efficient angle of attack\\nat all engine and airplane speeds. Lift versus drag\\ncurves, which are drawn for propellers as well as\\nwings, indicate that the most efficient angle of attack\\nis a small one varying from 2° to 4° positive. The\\nactual blade angle necessary to maintain this small\\nangle of attack varies with the forward speed of the\\nairplane.\\nFixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers are\\ndesigned for best efficiency at one rotation and for-\\nward speed. They are designed for a given airplane\\nand engine combination. A propeller may be used\\nthat provides the maximum propeller efficiency for\\neither takeoff, climb, cruise, or high-speed flight.\\nAny change in these conditions results in lowering\\nthe efficiency of both the propeller and the engine.\\nSince the efficiency of any machine is the ratio of\\nthe useful power output to the actual power input,\\npropeller efficiency is the ratio of thrust horsepower\\nto brake horsepower. Propeller efficiency varies\\nfrom 50 to 87 percent, depending on how much the\\npropeller “slips.”\\nPropeller slip is the difference between the geometric\\npitch of the propeller and its effective pitch.\\n[Figure 3-28] Geometric pitch is the theoretical\\ndistance a propeller should advance in one revolu-\\ntion; effective pitch is the distance it actually\\nadvances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is\\nbased on no slippage, but actual or effective pitch\\nincludes propeller slippage in the air.\\nFigure 3-28. Propeller slippage.\\nThe reason a propeller is “twisted” is that the outer\\nparts of the propeller blades, like all things that turn\\nabout a central point, travel faster than the portions\\nnear the hub. [Figure 3-29] If the blades had the\\nSlip\\nEffective Pitch\\nGeometric Pitch\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-22'),\n",

To put it\\nanother way, propeller blades are twisted to change\\nthe blade angle in proportion to the differences in\\nspeed of rotation along the length of the propeller\\nand thereby keep thrust more nearly equalized along\\nthis length.\\nFigure 3-29. Propeller tips travel faster than hubs.\\nUsually 1° to 4° provides the most efficient lift/drag\\nratio, but in flight the propeller angle of attack of a\\nfixed-pitch propeller will vary—normally from 0° to\\n15°. This variation is caused by changes in the rela-\\ntive airstream which in turn results from changes in\\nairplane speed. In short, propeller angle of attack is\\nthe product of two motions: propeller rotation about\\nits axis and its forward motion.\\nA constant-speed propeller, however, automatically\\nkeeps the blade angle adjusted for maximum effi-\\nciency for most conditions encountered in flight.\\nDuring takeoff, when maximum power and thrust\\nare required, the constant-speed propeller is at a low\\npropeller blade angle or pitch. The low blade angle\\nkeeps the angle of attack small and efficient with\\nrespect to the relative wind. At the same time, it\\nallows the propeller to handle a smaller mass of air\\nper revolution. This light load allows the engine to\\nturn at high r.p.m. and to convert the maximum\\namount of fuel into heat energy in a given time. The\\nhigh r.p.m. also creates maximum thrust; for,\\nalthough the mass of air handled per revolution is\\nsmall, the number of revolutions per minute is many,\\nthe slipstream velocity is high, and with the low air-\\nplane speed, the thrust is maximum.\\nAfter liftoff, as the speed of the airplane increases,\\nthe constant-speed propeller automatically changes\\nto a higher angle (or pitch). Again, the higher blade\\nangle keeps the angle of attack small and efficient\\nwith respect to the relative wind. The higher blade\\nangle increases the mass of air handled per revolu-\\ntion. This decreases the engine r.p.m., reducing fuel\\nconsumption and engine wear, and keeps thrust at a\\nmaximum.\\nAfter the takeoff climb is established in an airplane\\nhaving a controllable-pitch propeller, the pilot\\nreduces the power output of the engine to climb\\npower by first decreasing the manifold pressure and\\nthen increasing the blade angle to lower the r.p.m.\\nAt cruising altitude, when the airplane is in level\\nflight and less power is required than is used in take-\\noff or climb, the pilot again reduces engine power by\\nreducing the manifold pressure and then increasing\\nthe blade angle to decrease the r.p.m. Again, this pro-\\nvides a torque requirement to match the reduced\\nengine power; for, although the mass of air handled\\nper revolution is greater, it is more than offset by a\\ndecrease in slipstream velocity and an increase in\\nairspeed. The angle of attack is still small because\\nthe blade angle has been increased with an increase\\nin airspeed.\\nTORQUE AND P FACTOR\\nTo the pilot, “torque” (the left turning tendency of\\nthe airplane) is made up of four elements which\\ncause or produce a twisting or rotating motion\\naround at least one of the airplane’s three axes. These\\nfour elements are:\\n1. Torque Reaction from Engine and Propeller.\\n2. Corkscrewing Effect of the Slipstream.\\n3. Gyroscopic Action of the Propeller.\\n4. Asymmetric Loading of the Propeller (P Factor).\\nTORQUE REACTION\\nTorque reaction involves Newton’s Third Law of\\nPhysics—for every action, there is an equal and\\nopposite reaction. As applied to the airplane, this\\nmeans that as the internal engine parts and propeller\\nare revolving in one direction, an equal force is try-\\ning to rotate the airplane in the opposite direction.\\n[Figure 3-30]\\nModerateTravel Distance – Moderate Speed\\nShortTravel Distance\\nSlow Speed\\nGreater Travel Distance – Very High Speed\\n2500 r.p.m.\\n2500 r.p.m.\\n2500 r.p.m\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-23'),\n",

Torque reaction.\\nWhen the airplane is airborne, this force is acting\\naround the longitudinal axis, tending to make the air-\\nplane roll. To compensate for this, some of the older\\nairplanes are rigged in a manner to create more lift\\non the wing that is being forced downward. The\\nmore modern airplanes are designed with the engine\\noffset to counteract this effect of torque.\\nNOTE—Most United States built aircraft engines\\nrotate the propeller clockwise, as viewed from the\\npilot’s seat. The discussion here is with reference to\\nthose engines.\\nGenerally, the compensating factors are permanently\\nset so that they compensate for this force at cruising\\nspeed, since most of the airplane’s operating lift is at\\nthat speed. However, aileron trim tabs permit further\\nadjustment for other speeds.\\nWhen the airplane’s wheels are on the ground during\\nthe takeoff roll, an additional turning moment\\naround the vertical axis is induced by torque reac-\\ntion. As the left side of the airplane is being forced\\ndown by torque reaction, more weight is being\\nplaced on the left main landing gear. This results in\\nmore ground friction, or drag, on the left tire than on\\nthe right, causing a further turning moment to the\\nleft. The magnitude of this moment is dependent on\\nmany variables. Some of these variables are: (1) size\\nand horsepower of engine, (2) size of propeller and\\nthe r.p.m., (3) size of the airplane, and (4) condition\\nof the ground surface.\\nThis yawing moment on the takeoff roll is corrected\\nby the pilot’s proper use of the rudder or rudder trim.\\nCORKSCREW EFFECT\\nThe high-speed rotation of an airplane propeller\\ngives a corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slip-\\nstream. At high propeller speeds and low forward\\nspeed (as in the takeoffs and approaches to power-\\non stalls), this spiraling rotation is very compact\\nand exerts a strong sideward force on the airplane’s\\nvertical tail surface. [Figure 3-31]\\nWhen this spiraling slipstream strikes the vertical fin\\non the left, it causes a left turning moment about the\\nairplane’s vertical axis. The more compact the spiral,\\nthe more prominent this force is. As the forward\\nspeed increases, however, the spiral elongates and\\nbecomes less effective.\\nThe corkscrew flow of the slipstream also causes a\\nrolling moment around the longitudinal axis.\\nNote that this rolling moment caused by the\\ncorkscrew flow of the slipstream is to the right, while\\nthe rolling moment caused by torque reaction is to\\nthe left—in effect one may be counteracting the\\nother. However, these forces vary greatly and it is up\\nto the pilot to apply proper correction action by use\\nof the flight controls at all times. These forces must\\nbe counteracted regardless of which is the most\\nprominent at the time.\\nGYROSCOPIC ACTION\\nBefore the gyroscopic effects of the propeller can be\\nunderstood, it is necessary to understand the basic\\nprinciple of a gyroscope.\\nAll practical applications of the gyroscope are based\\nupon two fundamental properties of gyroscopic\\naction: rigidity in space and precession. The one of\\ninterest for this discussion is precession.\\nPrecession is the resultant action, or deflection, of a\\nspinning rotor when a deflecting force is applied to\\nits rim. As can be seen in figure 3-32, when a force is\\napplied, the resulting force takes effect 90° ahead of\\nand in the direction of rotation.\\nThe rotating propeller of an airplane makes a very\\ngood gyroscope and thus has similar properties. Any\\ntime a force is applied to deflect the propeller out of\\nits plane of rotation, the resulting force is 90° ahead\\nof and in the direction of rotation and in the direction\\nof application, causing a pitching moment, a yawing\\nmoment, or a combination of the two depending\\nupon the point at which the force was applied.\\nAction\\nReaction\\nProp Rotation\\nYaw\\nSlipstream\\nForce\\nFigure 3-31.

The resultant force\\nacting 90° ahead causes a yawing moment to the\\nleft around the vertical axis. The magnitude of this\\nmoment depends on several variables, one of\\nwhich is the abruptness with which the tail is\\nraised (amount of force applied). However, preces-\\nsion, or gyroscopic action, occurs when a force is\\napplied to any point on the rim of the propeller’s\\nplane of rotation; the resultant force will still be\\n90° from the point of application in the direction\\nof rotation. Depending on where the force is\\napplied, the airplane is caused to yaw left or right,\\nto pitch up or down, or a combination of pitching\\nand yawing.\\nIt can be said that as a result of gyroscopic action—\\nany yawing around the vertical axis results in a\\npitching moment, and any pitching around the lateral\\naxis results in a yawing moment.\\nTo correct for the effect of gyroscopic action, it is\\nnecessary for the pilot to properly use elevator and\\nrudder to prevent undesired pitching and yawing.\\nASYMMETRIC LOADING (P FACTOR)\\nWhen an airplane is flying with a high angle of\\nattack, the “bite” of the downward moving blade is\\ngreater than the “bite” of the upward moving\\nblade; thus moving the center of thrust to the\\nright of the prop disc area—causing a yawing\\nmoment toward the left around the vertical axis.\\nThat explanation is correct; however, to prove\\nthis phenomenon, it would be necessary to work\\nwind vector problems on each blade, which gets\\nquite involved when considering both the angle\\nof attack of the airplane and the angle of attack of\\neach blade.\\nThis asymmetric loading is caused by the resultant\\nvelocity, which is generated by the combination of\\nthe velocity of the propeller blade in its plane of\\nrotation and the velocity of the air passing horizon-\\ntally through the propeller “disc.” With the airplane\\nbeing flown at positive angles of attack, the right\\n(viewed from the rear) or downswinging blade, is\\npassing through an area of resultant velocity which\\nis greater than that affecting the left or upswinging\\nblade. Since the propeller blade is an airfoil,\\nincreased velocity means increased lift. Therefore,\\nthe downswinging blade having more “lift” tends\\nto pull (yaw) the airplane’s nose to the left.\\nSimply stated, when the airplane is flying at a high\\nangle of attack, the downward moving blade has a\\nhigher resultant velocity; therefore creating more lift\\nthan the upward moving blade. [Figure 3-34] This\\nmight be easier to visualize if the propeller shaft was\\nmounted perpendicular to the ground (like a\\nhelicopter). If there were no air movement at\\nall, except that generated by the propeller\\nitself, identical sections of each blade would\\nhave the same airspeed. However, with air mov-\\ning horizontally across this vertically mounted\\npropeller, the blade proceeding forward into the\\nflow of air will have a higher airspeed than the\\nblade retreating with the airflow. Thus, the blade\\nproceeding into the horizontal airflow is creating\\nmore lift, or thrust, moving the center of thrust\\ntoward that blade.

In one\\nphase of flight, one of these elements may be more\\nprominent than another; whereas, in another phase\\nof flight, another element may be more prominent.\\nThe relationship of these values to each other will\\nvary with different airplanes—depending on the\\nAIRFRAME, ENGINE, AND PROPELLER com-\\nbinations as well as other design features.\\nTo maintain positive control of the airplane in all\\nflight conditions, the pilot must apply the flight con-\\ntrols as necessary to compensate for these varying\\nvalues.\\nLOAD FACTORS\\nThe preceding sections only briefly considered some\\nof the practical points of the principles of flight. To\\nbecome a pilot, a detailed technical course in the\\nscience of aerodynamics is not necessary. However,\\nwith responsibilities for the safety of passengers, the\\ncompetent pilot must have a well-founded concept of\\nthe forces which act on the airplane, and the advanta-\\ngeous use of these forces, as well as the operating\\nlimitations of the particular airplane. Any force\\napplied to an airplane to deflect its flight from a\\nstraight line produces a stress on its structure; the\\namount of this force is termed “load factor.”\\nA load factor is the ratio of the total airload acting on\\nthe airplane to the gross weight of the airplane. For\\nexample, a load factor of 3 means that the total load\\non an airplane’s structure is three times its gross\\nweight. Load factors are usually expressed in terms\\nof “G”—that is, a load factor of 3 may be spoken of\\nas 3 G’s, or a load factor of 4 as 4 G’s.\\nIt is interesting to note that in subjecting an airplane\\nto 3 G’s in a pullup from a dive, one will be pressed\\ndown into the seat with a force equal to three times\\nthe person’s weight. Thus, an idea of the magnitude\\nof the load factor obtained in any maneuver can be\\ndetermined by considering the degree to which one\\nis pressed down into the seat. Since the operating\\nspeed of modern airplanes has increased signifi-\\ncantly, this effect has become so pronounced that it\\nis a primary consideration in the design of the\\nstructure for all airplanes.\\nWith the structural design of airplanes planned to\\nwithstand only a certain amount of overload, a\\nknowledge of load factors has become essential for\\nall pilots. Load factors are important to the pilot for\\ntwo distinct reasons:\\n1. Because of the obviously dangerous overload that\\nis possible for a pilot to impose on the airplane\\nstructures; and\\n2. Because an increased load factor increases the\\nstalling speed and makes stalls possible at seem-\\ningly safe flight speeds.\\nLOAD FACTORS IN AIRPLANE DESIGN\\nThe answer to the question “how strong should an\\nairplane be” is determined largely by the use to which\\nthe airplane will be subjected. This is a difficult prob-\\nlem, because the maximum possible loads are much\\ntoo high for use in efficient design. It is true that any\\npilot can make a very hard landing or an extremely\\nsharp pullup from a dive, which would result in\\nabnormal loads. However, such extremely abnormal\\nloads must be dismissed somewhat if airplanes are\\nbuilt that will take off quickly, land slowly, and carry\\na worthwhile payload.\\nThe problem of load factors in airplane design then\\nreduces to that of determining the highest load fac-\\ntors that can be expected in normal operation under\\nvarious operational situations. These load factors\\nare called “limit load factors.” For reasons of\\nsafety, it is required that the airplane be designed to\\nwithstand these load factors without any structural\\ndamage. Although the Code of Federal Regulations\\nrequires that the airplane structure be capable of\\nsupporting one and one-half times these limit load\\nfactors without failure, it is accepted that parts of\\nthe airplane may bend or twist under these loads\\nand that some structural damage may occur.\\nThis 1.5 value is called the “factor of safety” and\\nprovides, to some extent, for loads higher than those\\nexpected under normal and reasonable operation.\\nHowever, this strength reserve is not something\\nwhich pilots should willfully abuse; rather it is there\\nfor their protection when they encounter unexpected\\nconditions.\\nThe above considerations apply to all loading con-\\nditions, whether they be due to gusts, maneuvers, or\\nlandings. The gust load factor requirements now in\\neffect are substantially the same as those that have\\nbeen in existence for years. Hundreds of thousands\\nof operational hours have proven them adequate for\\nsafety. Since the pilot has little control over gust\\nload factors (except to reduce the airplane’s speed\\nwhen rough air is encountered), the gust loading\\nrequirements are substantially the same for most\\ngeneral aviation type airplanes regardless of their\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-26'),\n",

Generally, the gust load factors con-\\ntrol the design of airplanes which are intended for\\nstrictly nonacrobatic usage.\\nAn entirely different situation exists in airplane\\ndesign with maneuvering load factors. It is necessary\\nto discuss this matter separately with respect to: (1)\\nAirplanes which are designed in accordance with the\\nCategory System (i.e., Normal, Utility, Acrobatic);\\nand (2) Airplanes of older design which were built to\\nrequirements which did not provide for operational\\ncategories.\\nAirplanes designed under the Category System are\\nreadily identified by a placard in the cockpit, which\\nstates the operational category (or categories) in\\nwhich the airplane is certificated. The maximum safe\\nload factors (limit load factors) specified for air-\\nplanes in the various categories are as follows:\\nCATEGORY LIMIT LOAD\\nNormal1 3.8 to –1.52\\nUtility (mild acrobatics, including spins)   4.4 to –1.76\\nAcrobatic 6.0 to –3.0 \\n1 For airplanes with gross weight of more than 4,000\\npounds, the limit load factor is reduced. To the limit\\nloads given above, a safety factor of 50 percent is\\nadded.\\nThere is an upward graduation in load factor with the\\nincreasing severity of maneuvers. The Category\\nSystem provides for obtaining the maximum utility\\nof an airplane. If normal operation alone is intended,\\nthe required load factor (and consequently the\\nweight of the airplane) is less than if the airplane is\\nto be employed in training or acrobatic maneuvers as\\nthey result in higher maneuvering loads.\\nAirplanes that do not have the category placard are\\ndesigns that were constructed under earlier engineer-\\ning requirements in which no operational restrictions\\nwere specifically given to the pilots. For airplanes of\\nthis type (up to weights of about 4,000 pounds) the\\nrequired strength is comparable to present-day util-\\nity category airplanes, and the same types of opera-\\ntion are permissible. For airplanes of this type over\\n4,000 pounds, the load factors decrease with weight\\nso that these airplanes should be regarded as being\\ncomparable to the normal category airplanes\\ndesigned under the Category System, and they\\nshould be operated accordingly.\\nLOAD FACTORS IN STEEP TURNS\\nIn a constant altitude, coordinated turn in any air-\\nplane, the load factor is the result of two forces:\\ncentrifugal force and gravity. [Figure 3-35] For any\\ngiven bank angle, the rate of turn varies with the\\nairspeed; the higher the speed, the slower the rate of\\nturn. This compensates for added centrifugal force,\\nallowing the load factor to remain the same.Figure 3-35. Two forces cause load factor during turns.\\nFigure 3-36 reveals an important fact about turns—\\nthat the load factor increases at a terrific rate after a\\nbank has reached 45° or 50°. The load factor for\\nany airplane in a 60° bank is 2 G’s. The load factor\\nin an 80° bank is 5.76 G’s. The wing must produce\\nlift equal to these load factors if altitude is to be\\nmaintained.\\nFigure 3-36. Angle of bank changes load factor.\\nIt should be noted how rapidly the line denoting load\\nfactor rises as it approaches the 90° bank line, which\\nit reaches only at infinity. The 90° banked, constant\\naltitude turn mathematically is not possible.

At slightly more than 80°, the load\\nfactor exceeds the limit of 6 G’s, the limit load\\nfactor of an acrobatic airplane.\\nFor a coordinated, constant altitude turn, the\\napproximate maximum bank for the average general\\naviation airplane is 60°. This bank and its resultant\\nnecessary power setting reach the limit of this type\\nof airplane. An additional 10° bank will increase the\\nload factor by approximately 1 G, bringing it close\\nto the yield point established for these airplanes.\\n[Figure 3-36]\\nLOAD FACTORS AND STALLING SPEEDS\\nAny airplane, within the limits of its structure, may\\nbe stalled at any airspeed. When a sufficiently high\\nangle of attack is imposed, the smooth flow of air\\nover an airfoil breaks up and separates, producing an\\nabrupt change of flight characteristics and a sudden\\nloss of lift, which results in a stall.\\nA study of this effect has revealed that the airplane’s\\nstalling speed increases in proportion to the square\\nroot of the load factor. This means that an airplane\\nwith a normal unaccelerated stalling speed of 50\\nknots can be stalled at 100 knots by inducing a load\\nfactor of 4 G’s. If it were possible for this airplane to\\nwithstand a load factor of 9, it could be stalled at a\\nspeed of 150 knots. Therefore, a competent pilot\\nshould be aware of the following:\\n• The danger of inadvertently stalling the airplane\\nby increasing the load factor, as in a steep turn or\\nspiral; and\\n• That in intentionally stalling an airplane above its\\ndesign maneuvering speed, a tremendous load\\nfactor is imposed.\\nReference to the charts in figures 3-36 and 3-37 will\\nshow that by banking the airplane to just beyond 72°\\nin a steep turn produces a load factor of 3, and the\\nstalling speed is increased significantly. If this turn is\\nmade in an airplane with a normal unaccelerated\\nstalling speed of 45 knots, the airspeed must be kept\\nabove 75 knots to prevent inducing a stall. A similar\\neffect is experienced in a quick pullup, or any\\nmaneuver producing load factors above 1 G. This\\nhas been the cause of accidents resulting from a sud-\\nden, unexpected loss of control, particularly in a\\nsteep turn or abrupt application of the back elevator\\ncontrol near the ground.\\nSince the load factor squares as the stalling speed\\ndoubles, it may be realized that tremendous loads\\nmay be imposed on structures by stalling an airplane\\nat relatively high airspeeds.\\nThe maximum speed at which an airplane may be\\nstalled safely is now determined for all new designs.\\nThis speed is called the “design maneuvering\\nspeed” (V\\nA) and is required to be entered in the\\nFAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nOperating Handbook (AFM/POH) of all recently\\ndesigned airplanes. For older general aviation air-\\nplanes, this speed will be approximately 1.7 times\\nthe normal stalling speed. Thus, an older airplane\\nwhich normally stalls at 60 knots must never be\\nstalled at above 102 knots (60 knots x 1.7 = 102\\nknots). An airplane with a normal stalling speed of\\nFigure 3-37.

(The above\\nfigures are an approximation to be considered as a\\nguide and are not the exact answers to any set of\\nproblems. The design maneuvering speed should be\\ndetermined from the particular airplane’s operating\\nlimitations when provided by the manufacturer.)\\nSince the leverage in the control system varies\\nwith different airplanes and some types employ\\n“balanced” control surfaces while others do not,\\nthe pressure exerted by the pilot on the controls\\ncannot be accepted as an index of the load factors\\nproduced in different airplanes. In most cases, load\\nfactors can be judged by the experienced pilot from\\nthe feel of seat pressure. They can also be meas-\\nured by an instrument called an “accelerometer,”\\nbut since this instrument is not common in general\\naviation training airplanes, the development of the\\nability to judge load factors from the feel of their\\neffect on the body is important. A knowledge of\\nthe principles outlined above is essential to the\\ndevelopment of this ability to estimate load factors.\\nA thorough knowledge of load factors induced by\\nvarying degrees of bank, and the significance of\\ndesign maneuvering speed (V\\nA) will aid in the pre-\\nvention of two of the most serious types of accidents:\\n1. Stalls from steep turns or excessive maneuvering\\nnear the ground; and\\n2. Structural failures during acrobatics or other vio-\\nlent maneuvers resulting from loss of control.\\nLOAD FACTORS AND FLIGHT MANEUVERS\\nCritical load factors apply to all flight maneuvers\\nexcept unaccelerated straight flight where a load\\nfactor of 1 G is always present. Certain maneuvers\\nconsidered in this section are known to involve rel-\\natively high load factors.\\nTURNS\\n— Increased load factors are a characteristic\\nof all banked turns. As noted in the section on load\\nfactors in steep turns and particularly figures 3-36\\nand 3-37, load factors become significant both to\\nflight performance and to the load on wing structure\\nas the bank increases beyond approximately 45°.\\nThe yield factor of the average light plane is reached at\\na bank of approximately 70° to 75°, and the stalling\\nspeed is increased by approximately one-half at a bank\\nof approximately 63°.\\nSTALLS— The normal stall entered from straight\\nlevel flight, or an unaccelerated straight climb, will\\nnot produce added load factors beyond the 1 G of\\nstraight-and-level flight. As the stall occurs, how-\\never, this load factor may be reduced toward zero,\\nthe factor at which nothing seems to have weight;\\nand the pilot has the feeling of “floating free in\\nspace.” In the event recovery is effected by snapping\\nthe elevator control forward, negative load factors,\\nthose which impose a down load on the wings and\\nraise the pilot from the seat, may be produced.\\nDuring the pullup following stall recovery, significant\\nload factors sometimes are induced. Inadvertently\\nthese may be further increased during excessive div-\\ning (and consequently high airspeed) and abrupt\\npullups to level flight. One usually leads to the other,\\nthus increasing the load factor. Abrupt pullups at high\\ndiving speeds may impose critical loads on airplane\\nstructures and may produce recurrent or secondary\\nstalls by increasing the angle of attack to that of\\nstalling.\\nAs a generalization, a recovery from a stall made\\nby diving only to cruising or design maneuvering\\nairspeed, with a gradual pullup as soon as the air-\\nspeed is safely above stalling, can be effected with\\na load factor not to exceed 2 or 2.5 G’s. A higher\\nload factor should never be necessary unless\\nrecovery has been effected with the airplane’s nose\\nnear or beyond the vertical attitude, or at extremely\\nlow altitudes to avoid diving into the ground.\\nSPINS\\n— Since a stabilized spin is not essentially\\ndifferent from a stall in any element other than\\nrotation, the same load factor considerations apply\\nas those that apply to stall recovery. Since spin\\nrecoveries usually are effected with the nose much\\nlower than is common in stall recoveries, higher\\nairspeeds and consequently higher load factors are\\nto be expected. The load factor in a proper spin\\nrecovery will usually be found to be about 2.5 G’s.\\nThe load factor during a spin will vary with the spin\\ncharacteristics of each airplane but is usually found\\nto be slightly above the 1 G of level flight. There are\\ntwo reasons this is true:\\n1. The airspeed in a spin is very low, usually within\\n2 knots of the unaccelerated stalling speeds; and\\n2. The airplane pivots, rather than turns, while it is\\nin a spin.\\nHIGH-SPEED STALLS— The average light plane\\nis not built to withstand the repeated application of\\nload factors common to high-speed stalls. The load\\nfactor necessary for these maneuvers produces a\\nstress on the wings and tail structure, which does not\\nleave a reasonable margin of safety in most light air-\\nplanes.\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-29'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-30\\nThe only way this stall can be induced at an airspeed\\nabove normal stalling involves the imposition of an\\nadded load factor, which may be accomplished by a\\nsevere pull on the elevator control. A speed of 1.7\\ntimes stalling speed (about 102 knots in a light air-\\nplane with a stalling speed of 60 knots) will produce\\na load factor of 3 G’s. Further, only a very narrow\\nmargin for error can be allowed for acrobatics in\\nlight airplanes. To illustrate how rapidly the load\\nfactor increases with airspeed, a high-speed stall at\\n112 knots in the same airplane would produce a load\\nfactor of 4 G’s.\\nCHANDELLES AND LAZY EIGHTS\\n— It would\\nbe difficult to make a definite statement concerning\\nload factors in these maneuvers as both involve\\nsmooth, shallow dives and pullups. The load factors\\nincurred depend directly on the speed of the dives\\nand the abruptness of the pullups.\\nGenerally, the better the maneuver is performed, the\\nless extreme will be the load factor induced. A chan-\\ndelle or lazy eight, in which the pullup produces a\\nload factor greater than 2 G’s will not result in as\\ngreat a gain in altitude, and in low-powered airplanes\\nit may result in a net loss of altitude.\\nThe smoothest pullup possible, with a moderate\\nload factor, will deliver the greatest gain in altitude\\nin a chandelle and will result in a better overall\\nperformance in both chandelles and lazy eights.\\nFurther, it will be noted that recommended entry\\nspeed for these maneuvers is generally near the\\nmanufacturer’s design maneuvering speed, thereby\\nallowing maximum development of load factors\\nwithout exceeding the load limits.\\nROUGH AIR\\n— All certificated airplanes are\\ndesigned to withstand loads imposed by gusts of\\nconsiderable intensity. Gust load factors increase\\nwith increasing airspeed and the strength used for\\ndesign purposes usually corresponds to the highest\\nlevel flight speed. In extremely rough air, as in thun-\\nderstorms or frontal conditions, it is wise to reduce\\nthe speed to the design maneuvering speed.\\nRegardless of the speed held, there may be gusts that\\ncan produce loads which exceed the load limits.\\nMost airplane flight manuals now include turbulent\\nair penetration information. Operators of modern\\nairplanes, capable of a wide range of speeds and\\naltitudes, are benefited by this added feature both in\\ncomfort and safety. In this connection, it is to be\\nnoted that the maximum “never-exceed” placard\\ndive speeds are determined for smooth air only.\\nHigh-speed dives or acrobatics involving speed\\nabove the known maneuvering speed should never\\nbe practiced in rough or turbulent air.\\nIn summary, it must be remembered that load factors\\ninduced by intentional acrobatics, abrupt pullups\\nfrom dives, high-speed stalls, and gusts at high air-\\nspeeds all place added stress on the entire structure\\nof an airplane.\\nStress on the structure involves forces on any part of\\nthe airplane. There is a tendency for the uninformed\\nto think of load factors only in terms of their effect\\non spars and struts. Most structural failures due to\\nexcess load factors involve rib structure within the\\nleading and trailing edges of wings and tail group.\\nThe critical area of fabric-covered airplanes is the\\ncovering about one-third of the chord aft on the top\\nsurface of the wing.\\nThe cumulative effect of such loads over a long\\nperiod of time may tend to loosen and weaken vital\\nparts so that actual failure may occur later when the\\nairplane is being operated in a normal manner.\\nVG DIAGRAM\\nThe flight operating strength of an airplane is pre-\\nsented on a graph whose horizontal scale is based on\\nload factor. [Figure 3-38] The diagram is called a Vg\\ndiagram—velocity versus “g” loads or load factor.\\nEach airplane has its own Vg diagram which is valid\\nat a certain weight and altitude.\\nThe lines of maximum lift capability (curved lines)\\nare the first items of importance on the Vg diagram.\\nThe subject airplane in the illustration is capable of\\ndeveloping no more than one positive “g” at 62\\nm.p.h., the wing level stall speed of the airplane.\\nSince the maximum load factor varies with the\\nsquare of the airspeed, the maximum positive lift\\ncapability of this airplane is 2 “g” at 92 m.p.h., 3\\n“g” at 112 m.p.h., 4.4 “g” at 137 m.p.h., and so\\nforth. Any load factor above this line is unavailable\\naerodynamically; i.e., the subject airplane cannot\\nfly above the line of maximum lift capability (it\\nwill stall). Essentially the same situation exists for\\nnegative lift flight with the exception that the speed\\nnecessary to produce a given negative load factor is\\nhigher than that to produce the same positive load\\nfactor.\\nIf the subject airplane is flown at a positive load\\nfactor greater than the positive limit load factor of\\n4.4, structural damage will be possible. When the\\nairplane is operated in this region, objectionable\\npermanent deformation of the primary structure\\nmay take place and a high rate of fatigue damage is\\nincurred. Operation above the limit load factor\\nmust be avoided in normal operation.\\nThere are two other points of importance on the Vg\\ndiagram. First, is the intersection of the positive limit\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-30'),\n",

The airspeed at this point is the minimum\\nairspeed at which the limit load can be developed\\naerodynamically. Any airspeed greater than this pro-\\nvides a positive lift capability sufficient to damage\\nthe airplane; any airspeed less does not provide\\npositive lift capability sufficient to cause damage\\nfrom excessive flight loads. The usual term given to\\nthis speed is “maneuvering speed,” since consideration\\nof subsonic aerodynamics would predict minimum\\nusable turn radius to occur at this condition. The\\nmaneuver speed is a valuable reference point, since an\\nairplane operating below this point cannot produce a\\ndamaging positive flight load. Any combination of\\nmaneuver and gust cannot create damage due to excess\\nairload when the airplane is below the maneuver\\nspeed.\\nNext, is the intersection of the negative limit load\\nfactor and line of maximum negative lift capability.\\nAny airspeed greater than this provides a negative\\nlift capability sufficient to damage the airplane; any\\nairspeed less does not provide negative lift capabil-\\nity sufficient to damage the airplane from excessive\\nflight loads.\\nThe limit airspeed (or redline speed) is a design ref-\\nerence point for the airplane—the subject airplane is\\nlimited to 225 m.p.h. If flight is attempted beyond\\nthe limit airspeed, structural damage or structural\\nfailure may result from a variety of phenomena.\\nThus, the airplane in flight is limited to a regime of\\nairspeeds and g’s which do not exceed the limit (or\\nredline) speed, do not exceed the limit load factor,\\nand cannot exceed the maximum lift capability. The\\nairplane must be operated within this “envelope” to\\nprevent structural damage and ensure that the antic-\\nipated service lift of the airplane is obtained. The\\npilot must appreciate the Vg diagram as describing\\nthe allowable combination of airspeeds and load\\nfactors for safe operation. Any maneuver, gust, or\\ngust plus maneuver outside the structural envelope\\ncan cause structural damage and effectively shorten\\nthe service life of the airplane.\\nWEIGHT AND BALANCE\\nOften a pilot regards the airplane’s weight and balance\\ndata as information of interest only to engineers,\\ndispatchers, and operators of scheduled and non-\\nscheduled air carriers. Along with this idea, the\\nreasoning is that the airplane was weighed during\\nthe certification process and that this data is valid\\nindefinitely, regardless of equipment changes or\\nmodifications. Further, this information is mistakenly\\nreduced to a workable routine or “rule of thumb”\\nsuch as: “If I have three passengers, I can load only\\n100 gallons of fuel; four passengers—70 gallons.”\\nFigure 3-38.

The importance of the CG should have become\\napparent in the discussion of stability, controllability,\\nand performance. If all pilots understood and\\nrespected the effect of CG on an airplane, then one\\ntype of accident would be eliminated from the\\nrecords: “PRIMARY CAUSE OF ACCIDENT—\\nAIRPLANE CENTER OF GRAVITY OUT OF\\nREARWARD LIMITS AND UNEQUAL LOAD\\nDISTRIBUTION RESULTING IN AN UNSTABLE\\nAIRPLANE. PILOT LOST CONTROL OF AIR-\\nPLANE ON TAKEOFF AND CRASHED.”\\nThe reasons airplanes are so certificated are obvious\\nwhen one gives it a little thought. For instance, it is\\nof added value to the pilot to be able to carry extra\\nfuel for extended flights when the full complement\\nof passengers is not to be carried. Further, it is unrea-\\nsonable to forbid the carriage of baggage when it is\\nonly during spins that its weight will adversely affect\\nthe airplane’s flight characteristics. Weight and bal-\\nance limits are placed on airplanes for two principal\\nreasons:\\n1. Because of the effect of the weight on the air-\\nplane’s primary structure and its performance\\ncharacteristics; and\\n2. Because of the effect the location of this weight\\nhas on flight characteristics, particularly in stall\\nand spin recovery and stability.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT ON \\nFLIGHT PERFORMANCE\\nThe takeoff/climb and landing performance of an\\nairplane are determined on the basis of its maximum\\nallowable takeoff and landing weights. A heavier\\ngross weight will result in a longer takeoff run and\\nshallower climb, and a faster touchdown speed and\\nlonger landing roll. Even a minor overload may\\nmake it impossible for the airplane to clear an obsta-\\ncle that normally would not have been seriously\\nconsidered during takeoffs under more favorable\\nconditions.\\nThe detrimental effects of overloading on performance\\nare not limited to the immediate hazards involving\\ntakeoffs and landings. Overloading has an adverse\\neffect on all climb and cruise performance which leads\\nto overheating during climbs, added wear on engine\\nparts, increased fuel consumption, slower cruising\\nspeeds, and reduced range.\\nThe manufacturers of modern airplanes furnish\\nweight and balance data with each airplane produced.\\nGenerally, this information may be found in the FAA-\\napproved Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s Operating\\nHandbook (AFM/POH). With the advancements in\\nairplane design and construction in recent years has\\ncome the development of “easy to read charts” for\\ndetermining weight and balance data. Increased\\nperformance and load carrying capability of these\\nairplanes require strict adherence to the operating\\nlimitations prescribed by the manufacturer.\\nDeviations from the recommendations can result in\\nstructural damage or even complete failure of the\\nairplane’s structure. Even if an airplane is loaded\\nwell within the maximum weight limitations, it is\\nimperative that weight distribution be within the\\nlimits of center of gravity location. The preceding\\nbrief study of aerodynamics and load factors points\\nout the reasons for this precaution. The following\\ndiscussion is background information into some of\\nthe reasons why weight and balance conditions are\\nimportant to the safe flight of an airplane.\\nThe pilot is often completely unaware of the weight\\nand balance limitations of the airplane being flown\\nand of the reasons for these limitations. In some air-\\nplanes, it is not possible to fill all seats, baggage\\ncompartments, and fuel tanks, and still remain\\nwithin approved weight or balance limits. As an\\nexample, in several popular four-place airplanes the\\nfuel tanks may not be filled to capacity when four\\noccupants and their baggage are carried. In a certain\\ntwo-place airplane, no baggage may be carried in\\nthe compartment aft of the seats when spins are to\\nbe practiced.\\nEFFECT OF WEIGHT ON \\nAIRPLANE STRUCTURE\\nThe effect of additional weight on the wing structure\\nof an airplane is not readily apparent. Airworthiness\\nrequirements prescribe that the structure of an air-\\nplane certificated in the normal category (in which\\nacrobatics are prohibited) must be strong enough\\nto withstand a load factor of 3.8 to take care of\\ndynamic loads caused by maneuvering and gusts.\\nThis means that the primary structure of the airplane\\ncan withstand a load of 3.8 times the approved gross\\nweight of the airplane without structural failure\\noccurring. If this is accepted as indicative of the\\nload factors that may be imposed during operations\\nfor which the airplane is intended, a 100-pound\\noverload imposes a potential structural overload\\nof 380 pounds. The same consideration is even\\nmore impressive in the case of utility and acrobatic\\ncategory airplanes, which have load factor\\nrequirements of 4.4 and 6.0 respectively.\\nStructural failures which result from overloading\\nmay be dramatic and catastrophic, but more often\\nthey affect structural components progressively in a\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-32'),\n",

One of the most serious results of habitual\\noverloading is that its results tend to be cumulative,\\nand may result in structural failure later during com-\\npletely normal operations. The additional stress\\nplaced on structural parts by overloading is believed to\\naccelerate the occurrence of metallic fatigue failures.\\nA knowledge of load factors imposed by flight\\nmaneuvers and gusts will emphasize the conse-\\nquences of an increase in the gross weight of an\\nairplane. The structure of an airplane about to\\nundergo a load factor of 3 G’s, as in the recovery\\nfrom a steep dive, must be prepared to withstand\\nan added load of 300 pounds for each 100-pound\\nincrease in weight. It should be noted that this\\nwould be imposed by the addition of about 16 gallons\\nof unneeded fuel in a particular airplane. The FAA\\ncertificated civil airplane has been analyzed struc-\\nturally, and tested for flight at the maximum gross\\nweight authorized and within the speeds posted for\\nthe type of flights to be performed. Flights at weights\\nin excess of this amount are quite possible and often\\nare well within the performance capabilities of an\\nairplane. Nonetheless, this fact should not be\\nallowed to mislead the pilot, as the pilot may not\\nrealize that loads for which the airplane was not\\ndesigned are being imposed on all or some part of\\nthe structure.\\nIn loading an airplane with either passengers or\\ncargo, the structure must be considered. Seats,\\nbaggage compartments, and cabin floors are\\ndesigned for a certain load or concentration of\\nload and no more. As an example, a light plane\\nbaggage compartment may be placarded for 20\\npounds because of the limited strength of its sup-\\nporting structure even though the airplane may not\\nbe overloaded or out of center-of-gravity limits\\nwith more weight at that location.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT ON \\nSTABILITY AND CONTROLLABILITY\\nThe effects that overloading has on stability also are\\nnot generally recognized. An airplane, which is\\nobserved to be quite stable and controllable when\\nloaded normally, may be discovered to have very\\ndifferent flight characteristics when it is overloaded.\\nAlthough the distribution of weight has the most\\ndirect effect on this, an increase in the airplane’s\\ngross weight may be expected to have an adverse\\neffect on stability, regardless of location of the\\ncenter of gravity.\\nThe stability of many certificated airplanes is com-\\npletely unsatisfactory if the gross weight is\\nexceeded.\\nEFFECT OF LOAD DISTRIBUTION\\nThe effect of the position of the center of gravity\\non the load imposed on an airplane’s wing in flight\\nis not generally realized, although it may be very\\nsignificant to climb and cruising performance.\\nContrary to the beliefs of some pilots, an airplane\\nwith forward loading is “heavier” and conse-\\nquently, slower than the same airplane with the\\ncenter of gravity further aft.\\nFigure 3-39 illustrates the reason for this. With forward\\nloading, “nose-up” trim is required in most airplanes\\nto maintain level cruising flight. Nose-up trim\\ninvolves setting the tail surfaces to produce a\\ngreater down load on the aft portion of the fuselage,\\nwhich adds to the wing loading and the total lift\\nrequired from the wing if altitude is to be main-\\ntained. This requires a higher angle of attack of\\nthe wing, which results in more drag and, in turn,\\nproduces a higher stalling speed.\\nFigure 3-39. Load distribution affects balance.\\nWith aft loading and “nose-down” trim, the tail sur-\\nfaces will exert less down load, relieving the wing of\\nthat much wing loading and lift required to maintain\\naltitude. The required angle of attack of the wing is\\nless, so the drag is less, allowing for a faster cruise\\nspeed. Theoretically, a neutral load on the tail surfaces\\nin cruising flight would produce the most efficient\\noverall performance and fastest cruising speed, but\\nwould also result in instability. Consequently, modern\\nairplanes are designed to require a down load on the\\ntail for stability and controllability.\\nRemember that a zero indication on the trim tab con-\\ntrol is not necessarily the same as “neutral trim”\\nbecause of the force exerted by downwash from the\\nwings and the fuselage on the tail surfaces.\\nThe effects of the distribution of the airplane’s use-\\nful load have a significant influence on its flight\\nCenter\\nof Lift\\nCenter\\nof Lift\\nLoad Imposed\\nby Tail\\nGross Weight\\nForward\\nCG Load Imposed\\nby Tail\\nGross Weight\\nAFT CG\\nStronger\\nDown Load\\non Tail\\nLighter\\nDown Load\\non Tail\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-33'),\n",

Important among these effects are\\nchanges in controllability, stability, and the actual\\nload imposed on the wing.\\nGenerally, an airplane becomes less controllable,\\nespecially at slow flight speeds, as the center of\\ngravity is moved further aft. An airplane which\\ncleanly recovers from a prolonged spin with the\\ncenter of gravity at one position may fail completely\\nto respond to normal recovery attempts when the\\ncenter of gravity is moved aft by 1 or 2 inches.\\nIt is common practice for airplane designers to\\nestablish an aft center-of-gravity limit that is within\\n1 inch of the maximum which will allow normal\\nrecovery from a one-turn spin. When certificating\\nan airplane in the utility category to permit inten-\\ntional spins, the aft center-of-gravity limit is usually\\nestablished at a point several inches forward of that\\nwhich is permissible for certification in the normal\\ncategory.\\nAnother factor affecting controllability, which is\\nbecoming more important in current designs of large\\nairplanes, is the effect of long moment arms to the\\npositions of heavy equipment and cargo. The same\\nairplane may be loaded to maximum gross weight\\nwithin its center-of-gravity limits by concentrating\\nfuel, passengers, and cargo near the design center of\\ngravity; or by dispersing fuel and cargo loads in\\nwingtip tanks and cargo bins forward and aft of the\\ncabin.\\nWith the same total weight and center of gravity,\\nmaneuvering the airplane or maintaining level flight\\nin turbulent air will require the application of greater\\ncontrol forces when the load is dispersed. This is true\\nbecause of the longer moment arms to the positions of\\nthe heavy fuel and cargo loads which must be over-\\ncome by the action of the control surfaces. An airplane\\nwith full outboard wing tanks or tip tanks tends to be\\nsluggish in roll when control situations are marginal,\\nwhile one with full nose and aft cargo bins tends to be\\nless responsive to the elevator controls.\\nThe rearward center-of-gravity limit of an airplane is\\ndetermined largely by considerations of stability.\\nThe original airworthiness requirements for a type\\ncertificate specify that an airplane in flight at a cer-\\ntain speed will dampen out vertical displacement\\nof the nose within a certain number of oscillations.\\nAn airplane loaded too far rearward may not do\\nthis; instead when the nose is momentarily pulled\\nup, it may alternately climb and dive becoming\\nsteeper with each oscillation. This instability is not\\nonly uncomfortable to occupants, but it could even\\nbecome dangerous by making the airplane unman-\\nageable under certain conditions.\\nThe recovery from a stall in any airplane becomes\\nprogressively more difficult as its center of gravity\\nmoves aft. This is particularly important in spin\\nrecovery, as there is a point in rearward loading of\\nany airplane at which a “flat” spin will develop. A\\nflat spin is one in which centrifugal force, acting\\nthrough a center of gravity located well to the rear,\\nwill pull the tail of the airplane out away from the\\naxis of the spin, making it impossible to get the nose\\ndown and recover.\\nAn airplane loaded to the rear limit of its permissible\\ncenter-of-gravity range will handle differently in\\nturns and stall maneuvers and have different landing\\ncharacteristics than when it is loaded near the for-\\nward limit.\\nThe forward center-of-gravity limit is determined by\\na number of considerations. As a safety measure, it\\nis required that the trimming device, whether tab or\\nadjustable stabilizer, be capable of holding the air-\\nplane in a normal glide with the power off. A con-\\nventional airplane must be capable of a full stall,\\npower-off landing in order to ensure minimum land-\\ning speed in emergencies. A tailwheel-type airplane\\nloaded excessively nose heavy will be difficult to\\ntaxi, particularly in high winds. It can be nosed over\\neasily by use of the brakes, and it will be difficult to\\nland without bouncing since it tends to pitch down\\non the wheels as it is slowed down and flared for\\nlanding. Steering difficulties on the ground may\\noccur in nosewheel-type airplanes, particularly dur-\\ning the landing roll and takeoff.\\n• The CG position influences the lift and angle of\\nattack of the wing, the amount and direction of\\nforce on the tail, and the degree of deflection of\\nthe stabilizer needed to supply the proper tail\\nforce for equilibrium. The latter is very important\\nbecause of its relationship to elevator control\\nforce.\\n• The airplane will stall at a higher speed with a\\nforward CG location. This is because the stalling\\nangle of attack is reached at a higher speed due to\\nincreased wing loading.\\n• Higher elevator control forces normally exist\\nwith a forward CG location due to the increased\\nstabilizer deflection required to balance the air-\\nplane.\\n• The airplane will cruise faster with an aft CG\\nlocation because of reduced drag. The drag is\\nreduced because a smaller angle of attack and less\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-34'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-35\\ndownward deflection of the stabilizer are\\nrequired to support the airplane and overcome the\\nnose-down pitching tendency.\\n• The airplane becomes less stable as the CG is\\nmoved rearward. This is because when the CG is\\nmoved rearward it causes an increase in the angle\\nof attack. Therefore, the wing contribution to the\\nairplane’s stability is now decreased, while the\\ntail contribution is still stabilizing. When the\\npoint is reached that the wing and tail contribu-\\ntions balance, then neutral stability exists. Any\\nCG movement further aft will result in an unsta-\\nble airplane.\\n• A forward CG location increases the need for\\ngreater back elevator pressure. The elevator may\\nno longer be able to oppose any increase in\\nnose-down pitching. Adequate elevator control\\nis needed to control the airplane throughout the\\nairspeed range down to the stall.\\nHIGH-SPEED FLIGHT\\nSUPERSONIC VS. SUBSONIC FLOW\\nIn subsonic aerodynamics, the theory of lift is based\\nupon the forces generated on a body and a moving\\ngas (air) in which it is immersed. At speeds below\\nabout 260 knots, air can be considered incompress-\\nible, in that at a fixed altitude, its density remains\\nnearly constant while its pressure varies. Under\\nthis assumption, air acts the same as water and is\\nclassified as a fluid. Subsonic aerodynamic theory\\nalso assumes the effects of viscosity (the property\\nof a fluid that tends to prevent motion of one part\\nof the fluid with respect to another) are negligible,\\nand classifies air as an ideal fluid, conforming to\\nthe principles of ideal-fluid aerodynamics such as\\ncontinuity, Bernoulli’s principle, and circulation.\\nIn reality, air is compressible and viscous. While the\\neffects of these properties are negligible at low\\nspeeds, compressibility effects in particular become\\nincreasingly important as speed increases.\\nCompressibility (and to a lesser extent viscosity) is\\nof paramount importance at speeds approaching the\\nspeed of sound. In these speed ranges, compressibil-\\nity causes a change in the density of the air around\\nan airplane.\\nDuring flight, a wing produces lift by accelerating\\nthe airflow over the upper surface. This accelerated\\nair can, and does, reach sonic speeds even though the\\nairplane itself may be flying subsonic. At some\\nextreme angles of attack, in some airplanes, the\\nspeed of the air over the top surface of the wing may\\nbe double the airplane’s speed. It is therefore entirely\\npossible to have both supersonic and subsonic air-\\nflow on an airplane at the same time. When flow\\nvelocities reach sonic speeds at some location on an\\nairplane (such as the area of maximum camber on\\nthe wing), further acceleration will result in the\\nonset of compressibility effects such as shock wave\\nformation, drag increase, buffeting, stability, and\\ncontrol difficulties. Subsonic flow principles are\\ninvalid at all speeds above this point. [Figure 3-40]\\nFigure 3-40. Wing airflow.\\nSPEED RANGES\\nThe speed of sound varies with temperature. Under\\nstandard temperature conditions of 15°C, the speed\\nof sound at sea level is 661 knots. At 40,000 feet,\\nwhere the temperature is –55°C, the speed of sound\\ndecreases to 574 knots. In high-speed flight and/or\\nhigh-altitude flight, the measurement of speed is\\nexpressed in terms of a “Mach number”—the ratio\\nof the true airspeed of the airplane to the speed of\\nsound in the same atmospheric conditions. An air-\\nplane traveling at the speed of sound is traveling at\\nMach 1.0. Airplane speed regimes are defined as\\nfollows:\\nSubsonic—Mach numbers below 0.75\\nTransonic—Mach numbers from .075 to 1.20\\nSupersonic—Mach numbers from 1.20 to 5.00\\nHypersonic—Mach numbers above 5.00\\nWhile flights in the transonic and supersonic ranges\\nare common occurrences for military airplanes,\\ncivilian jet airplanes normally operate in a cruise\\nspeed range of Mach 0.78 to Mach 0.90.\\nThe speed of an airplane in which airflow over any\\npart of the wing first reaches (but does not exceed)\\nMach 1.0 is termed that airplane’s critical Mach\\nnumber or “Mach Crit.” Thus, critical Mach number\\nM=.50\\nM=.72\\n(Critical Mach Number)\\nSupersonic\\nFlow\\nM=.77\\nNormal Shock Wave\\nSubsonic Possible Separation\\nMaximum Local Velocity\\nIs Less Than Sonic\\nMaximum Local Velocity\\nEqual To Sonic\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-35'),\n",

Shock waves, buffet, and airflow separation\\ntake place above critical Mach number. A jet airplane\\ntypically is most efficient when cruising at or near its\\ncritical Mach number. At speeds 5 – 10 percent above\\nthe critical Mach number, compressibility effects\\nbegin. Drag begins to rise sharply. Associated with\\nthe “drag rise” are buffet, trim and stability changes,\\nand a decrease in control surface effectiveness. This\\nis the point of “drag divergence,” and is typically the\\nspeed chosen for high-speed cruise operations. At\\nsome point beyond high-speed cruise are the turbine\\npowered airplane’s maximum operating limit\\nspeeds: V\\nMO/MMO. [Figure 3-41]\\nFigure 3-41. Critical Mach.\\nVMO is the maximum operating speed expressed in\\nterms of knots. V MO limits ram air pressure acting\\nagainst the structure and prevents flutter. M MO is the\\nmaximum operating speed expressed in terms of Mach\\nnumber. An airplane should not be flown in excess of\\nthis speed. Doing so risks encountering the full effects\\nof compressibility, including possible loss of control.\\nMACH NUMBER VS. AIRSPEED\\nSpeeds such as Mach Crit and M MO for a specific air-\\nplane occur at a given Mach number. The true airspeed\\n(TAS), however, varies with outside air temperature.\\nTherefore, true airspeeds corresponding to a specific\\nMach number can vary considerably (as much as 75 –\\n100 knots). When an airplane cruising at a constant\\nMach number enters an area of higher outside air tem-\\nperatures, true airspeed and required fuel increases, and\\nrange decreases. Conversely, when entering an area of\\ncolder outside air temperatures, true airspeed and fuel\\nflow decreases, and range increases.\\nIn a jet airplane operating at high altitude, the indicated\\nairspeed (IAS) for any given Mach number decreases\\nwith an increase in altitude above a certain level. The\\nreverse occurs during descent. Normally, climbs and\\ndescents are accomplished using indicated airspeed in\\nthe lower altitudes and Mach number in the higher\\naltitudes.\\nUnlike operations in the lower altitudes, the indi-\\ncated airspeed (IAS) at which a jet airplane stalls\\nincreases significantly with altitude. This is due to\\nthe fact that true airspeed (TAS) increases with\\naltitude. At high true airspeeds, air compression\\ncauses airflow distortion over the wings and in the\\npitot system. At the same time, the indicated airspeed\\n(IAS) representing M\\nMO decreases with altitude.\\nEventually, the airplane can reach an altitude where\\nthere is little or no difference between the two.\\nBOUNDARY LAYER\\nAir has viscosity, and will encounter resistance to\\nflow over a surface. The viscous nature of airflow\\nreduces the local velocities on a surface and is\\nresponsible for skin friction drag. As the air passes\\nover the wing’s surface, the air particles nearest the\\nsurface come to rest. The next layer of particles is\\nslowed down but not stopped. Some small but meas-\\nurable distance from the surface, the air particles are\\nmoving at free stream velocity. The layer of air over\\nthe wing’s surface, which is slowed down or stopped\\nby viscosity, is termed the “boundary layer.” Typical\\nboundary layer thicknesses on an airplane range\\nfrom small fractions of an inch near the leading edge\\nof a wing to the order of 12 inches at the aft end of a\\nlarge airplane such as a Boeing 747.\\nThere are two different types of boundary layer flow:\\nlaminar and turbulent. The laminar boundary layer is a\\nvery smooth flow, while the turbulent boundary layer\\ncontains swirls or “eddies.” The laminar flow creates\\nless skin friction drag than the turbulent flow, but is\\nless stable. Boundary layer flow over a wing surface\\nbegins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow continues\\nback from the leading edge, the laminar boundary layer\\nincreases in thickness. At some distance back from the\\nleading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down\\nand transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag\\nstandpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from\\nlaminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as\\npossible, or have a large amount of the wing surface\\nwithin the laminar portion of the boundary layer.

[Figure 3-42]\\n“Vortex Generators” are used to delay or prevent\\nshock wave induced boundary layer separation\\nencountered in transonic flight. Vortex generators\\nare small low aspect ratio airfoils placed at a 12° to\\n15° angle of attack to the airstream. They are usu-\\nally spaced a few inches apart along the wing\\nahead of the ailerons or other control surfaces.\\nVortex generators create a vortex which mixes the\\nboundary airflow with the high energy airflow just\\nabove the surface. This produces higher surface\\nvelocities and increases the energy of the boundary\\nlayer. Thus, a stronger shock wave will be necessary\\nto produce airflow separation.\\nSHOCK WAVES\\nWhen an airplane flies at subsonic speeds, the air\\nahead is “warned” of the airplane’s coming by a\\npressure change transmitted ahead of the airplane at\\nthe speed of sound. Because of this warning, the air\\nbegins to move aside before the airplane arrives and\\nis prepared to let it pass easily. When the airplane’s\\nspeed reaches the speed of sound, the pressure\\nchange can no longer warn the air ahead because the\\nairplane is keeping up with its own pressure waves.\\nRather, the air particles pile up in front of the air-\\nplane causing a sharp decrease in the flow velocity\\ndirectly in front of the airplane with a corresponding\\nincrease in air pressure and density.\\nAs the airplane’s speed increases beyond the speed\\nof sound, the pressure and density of the compressed\\nair ahead of it increase, the area of compression\\nextending some distance ahead of the airplane. At\\nsome point in the airstream, the air particles are\\ncompletely undisturbed, having had no advanced\\nwarning of the airplane’s approach, and in the next\\ninstant the same air particles are forced to undergo\\nsudden and drastic changes in temperature, pressure,\\ndensity, and velocity. The boundary between the\\nundisturbed air and the region of compressed air is\\ncalled a shock or “compression” wave.\\nThis same type of wave is formed whenever a super-\\nsonic airstream is slowed to subsonic without a change\\nin direction, such as when the airstream is accelerated\\nto sonic speed over the cambered portion of a wing, and\\nthen decelerates to subsonic speed as the area of maxi-\\nmum camber is passed. A shock wave will form as a\\nboundary between the supersonic and subsonic ranges.\\nWhen\\never a shock wave forms perpendicular to the\\nairflow, it is termed a “normal” shock wave, and the\\nflow immediately behind the wave is subsonic. A\\nsupersonic airstream passing through a normal shock\\nwave will experience these changes:\\n• The airstream is slowed to subsonic.\\n• The airflow immediately behind the shock wave\\ndoes not change direction.\\n• The static pressure and density of the airstream\\nbehind the wave is greatly increased.\\n• The energy of the airstream (indicated by total\\npressure—dynamic plus static) is greatly\\nreduced.\\nShock wave formation causes an increase in drag. One\\nof the principal effects of a shock wave is the formation\\nof a dense high pressure region immediately behind the\\nwave. The instability of the high pressure region, and\\nthe fact that part of the velocity energy of the airstream\\nis converted to heat as it flows through the wave is a\\ncontributing factor in the drag increase, but the drag\\nresulting from airflow separation is much greater. If the\\nshock wave is strong, the boundary layer may not have\\nsufficient kinetic energy to withstand airflow separa-\\ntion. The drag incurred in the transonic region due to\\nshock wave formation and airflow separation is known\\nas “wave drag.” When speed exceeds the critical Mach\\nnumber by about 10 percent, wave drag increases\\nsharply. A considerable increase in thrust (power) is\\nrequired to increase flight speed beyond this point into\\nthe supersonic range where, depending on the airfoil\\nshape and the angle of attack, the boundary layer may\\nreattach.\\nNormal shock \\nwaves form on the wing’s upper\\nsurface first.

Thus, a decrease in\\ndownwash decreases the\\nhorizontal tail’s pitch control\\neffectiveness. Movement of\\nthe wing center of pressure\\naffects the wing pitching\\nmoment. If the center of\\npressure moves aft, a diving\\nmoment referred to as\\n“Mach tuck” or “tuck under”\\nis produced, and if it moves\\nforward, a nose-up moment\\nis produced. This is the primary\\nreason for the development of\\nthe T-tail configuration on many turbine-powered\\nairplanes, which places the horizontal stabilizer as\\nfar as practical from the turbulence of the wings.\\nSWEEPBACK\\nMost of the difficulties of transonic flight are asso-\\nciated with shock wave induced flow separation.\\nTherefore, any means of delaying or alleviating the\\nshock induced separation will improve aerodynamic\\nperformance. One method is wing sweepback.\\nSweepback theory is based upon the concept that it\\nis only the component of the airflow perpendicular\\nto the leading edge of the wing that affects pressure\\ndistribution and formation of shock waves. [Figure\\n3-44]\\nOn a straight wing airplane, the airflow strikes the\\nwing leading edge at 90°, and its full impact produces\\npressure and lift. A wing with sweepback is struck by\\nthe same airflow at an angle smaller than 90°. This\\nairflow on the swept wing has the effect of persuading\\nthe wing into believing that it is flying slower than it\\nreally is; thus the formation of shock waves is\\ndelayed.

In other words, sweep will delay the onset of\\ncompressibility effects.\\nThe Mach number, which produces a sharp change in\\ndrag coefficient, is termed the “force divergence”\\nMach number and, for most airfoils, usually exceeds\\nthe critical Mach number by 5 to 10 percent. At this\\nspeed, the airflow separation induced by shock wave\\nformation can create significant variations in the drag,\\nlift, or pitching moment coefficients. In addition to\\nthe delay of the onset of compressibility effects,\\nsweepback reduces the magnitude in the changes of\\ndrag, lift or moment coefficients. In other words, the\\nuse of sweepback will “soften” the force divergence.\\nA disadvantage of swept wings is that they tend to\\nstall at the wingtips rather than at the wing roots.\\n[Figure 3-45] This is because the boundary layer tends\\nto flow spanwise toward the tips and to separate near\\nthe leading edges. Because the tips of a swept wing\\nare on the aft part of the wing (behind the center of\\nlift), a wingtip stall will cause the center of lift to\\nmove forward on the wing, forcing\\nthe nose to rise further. The tendency\\nfor tip stall is greatest when wing\\nsweep and taper are combined. \\nFigure 3-45 Wingtip stall.\\nThe stall situation can be aggravated by a T-tail config-\\nuration, which affords little or no pre-stall warning in\\nthe form of tail control surface buffet. [Figure 3-46]\\nThe T-tail, being above the wing wake remains\\neffective even after the wing has begun to stall,\\nallowing the pilot to inadvertently drive the wing\\ninto a deeper stall at a much greater angle of attack.\\nIf the horizontal tail surfaces then become buried in the\\nwing’s wake, the elevator may lose all effectiveness,\\nmaking it impossible to reduce pitch attitude and break\\nthe stall. In the pre-stall and immediate post-stall\\nregimes, the lift/drag qualities of a swept wing airplane\\n(specifically the enormous increase in drag at low\\nspeeds) can cause an increasingly descending flight-\\npath with no change in pitch attitude, further increasing\\nthe angle of attack. In this situation, without reliable\\nangle of attack information, a nose-down pitch attitude\\nwith an increasing airspeed is no guarantee that recovery\\nhas been effected, and up-elevator movement at this\\nstage may merely keep the airplane stalled.\\nIt is a characteristic of T-tail airplanes to pitch\\nup viciously when stalled in extreme nose-high\\nattitudes, making recovery difficult or violent. The\\nstick pusher inhibits this type of stall. At approxi-\\nmately one knot above stall speed, pre-programmed\\nstick forces automatically move the stick forward,\\npreventing the stall from developing. A “g” limiter\\nmay also be incorporated into the system to prevent\\nthe pitch down generated by the stick pusher from\\nimposing excessive loads on the airplane. A “stick\\nshaker,” on the other hand provides stall warning\\nwhen the airspeed is 5 to 7 percent above stall speed.\\nMACH BUFFET BOUNDARIES\\nThus far, only the Mach buffet that results from\\nexcessive speed has been addressed.

This very high\\nangle of attack would have the effect of increasing\\nairflow velocity over the upper surface of the wing\\nto the point that all of the same effects of the shock\\nwaves and buffet would occur as in the high-speed\\nbuffet situation. The angle of attack of the wing\\nhas the greatest effect on inducing the Mach buffet\\nat either the high-speed or low-speed boundaries\\nfor the airplane. The conditions that increase the\\nangle of attack, hence the speed of the airflow over\\nthe wing and chances of Mach buffet are as follows:\\n• High Altitudes —The higher an airplane flies, the\\nthinner the air and the greater the angle of attack\\nrequired to produce the lift needed to maintain\\nlevel flight.\\n• Heavy Weights —The heavier the airplane, the\\ngreater the lift required of the wing, and all other\\nthings being equal, the greater the angle of attack.\\n• “G” Loading —An increase in the “G” loading\\non the airplane has the same effect as increasing\\nthe weight of the airplane. Whether the increase\\nin “G” forces is caused by turns, rough control\\nusage, or turbulence, the effect of increasing the\\nwing’s angle of attack is the same.\\nFLIGHT CONTROLS\\nOn high-speed airplanes, flight controls are divided\\ninto primary flight controls and secondary or auxil-\\niary flight controls. The primary flight controls\\nmaneuver the airplane about the pitch, roll, and yaw\\naxes. They include the ailerons, elevator, and rudder.\\nSecondary or auxiliary flight controls include tabs,\\nleading edge flaps, trailing edge flaps, spoilers, and\\nslats.\\nSpoilers are used on the upper surface of the wing to\\nspoil or reduce lift. High-speed airplanes, due to\\ntheir clean low drag design use spoilers as speed\\nbrakes to slow them down. Spoilers are extended\\nimmediately after touchdown to dump lift and thus\\ntransfer the weight of the airplane from the wings\\nonto the wheels for better braking performance.\\n[Figure 3-47]\\nJet transport airplanes have small ailerons. The space\\nfor ailerons is limited because as much of the wing\\ntrailing edge as possible is needed for flaps. Another\\nreason is that a conventional size aileron would cause\\nwing twist at high speed. Because the ailerons are nec-\\nessarily small, spoilers are used in unison with ailerons\\nto provide additional roll control.\\nSome jet transports have two sets of ailerons; a pair of\\noutboard low-speed ailerons, and a pair of high-speed\\ninboard ailerons. When the flaps are fully retracted\\nafter takeoff, the outboard ailerons are automatically\\nlocked out in the faired position.\\nWhen used for roll control, the spoiler on the side of\\nthe up-going aileron extends and reduces the lift on that\\nside, causing the wing to drop. If the spoilers are\\nextended as speed brakes, they can still be used for roll\\ncontrol. If they are the Differential type, they will\\nextend further on one side and retract on the other side.\\nIf they are the Non-Differential type, they will extend\\nfurther on one side but will not retract on the other side.\\nWhen fully extended as speed brakes, the Non-\\nDifferential spoilers remain extended and do not sup-\\nplement the ailerons.\\nTo obtain a smooth stall and a higher angle of attack\\nwithout airflow separation, an airplane’s wing leading\\nedge should have a well-rounded almost blunt shape\\nthat the airflow can adhere to at the higher angle of\\nattack. With this shape, the airflow separation will start\\nat the trailing edge and progress forward gradually as\\nangle of attack is increased.\\nThe pointed leadi\\nng edge necessary for high-speed\\nflight results in an abrupt stall and restricts the use\\nof trailing edge flaps because the airflow cannot\\nfollow the sharp curve around the wing leading\\nedge. The airflow tends to tear loose rather suddenly\\nfrom the upper surface at a moderate angle of attack.\\nTo utilize trailing edge flaps, and thus increase the\\nmaximum lift coefficient, the wing must go to a\\nhigher angle of attack without airflow separation.\\nTherefore, leading edge slots, slats, and flaps are\\nused to improve the low-speed characteristics during\\ntakeoff, climb, and landing. Although these devices\\nare not as powerful as trailing edge flaps, they are\\neffective when used full span in combination with\\nhigh-lift trailing edge flaps. With the aid of these\\nsophisticated high-lift devices, airflow separation is\\ndelayed and the maximum lift coefficient (C\\nLmax) is\\nincreased considerably. In fact, a 50-knot reduction\\nin stall speed is not uncommon.\\nThe operational requirements of a large jet transport\\nairplane necessitate large pitch trim changes. Some\\nof these requirements are:\\n• The requirement for a large CG range.\\n• The need to cover a large speed range.\\nCH 03.qxd  10/24/03  6:44 AM  Page 3-40'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='3-41\\n• The need to cope with possibly large trim\\nchanges due to wing leading edge and trailing\\nedge high-lift devices without limiting the\\namount of elevator remaining.\\n• The need to reduce trim drag to a minimum.\\nThese requirements are met by the use of a variable\\nincidence horizontal stabilizer. Large trim changes\\non a fixed-tail airplane require large elevator deflec-\\ntions. At these large deflections, little further elevator\\nmovement remains in the same direction. A variable\\nincidence horizontal stabilizer is designed to take out\\nthe trim changes. The stabilizer is larger than the\\nelevator, and consequently does not need to be\\nmoved through as large an angle. This leaves the\\nelevator streamlining the tail plane with a full range\\nof movement up and down. The variable incidence\\nhorizontal stabilizer can be set to handle the bulk of\\nthe pitch control demand, with the elevator handling\\nthe rest. On airplanes equipped with a variable\\nincidence horizontal stabilizer, the elevator is\\nsmaller and less effective in isolation than it is on\\na fixed-tail airplane. In comparison to other flight\\ncontrols, the variable incidence horizontal stabi-\\nlizer is enormously powerful in its effect. Its use\\nand effect must be fully understood and appreci-\\nated by flight crewmembers.\\nBecause of the size and high speeds of jet transport\\nairplanes, the forces required to move the control\\nsurfaces can be beyond the strength of the pilot.\\nConsequently, the control surfaces are actuated by\\nhydraulic or electrical power units. Moving the con-\\ntrols in the cockpit signals the control angle\\nrequired, and the power unit positions the actual\\ncontrol surface. In the event of complete power unit\\nfailure, movement of the control surface can be\\neffected by manually controlling the control tabs.\\nMoving the control tab upsets the aerodynamic\\nbalance which causes the control surface to move.\\nLanding Flaps\\nInbd Wing\\nOutbd Wing\\nForeflap\\nMidflap\\nAftflap\\nAileron\\nTakeoff Flaps\\nInbd Wing\\nOutbd Wing\\nAileron\\nFlaps Retracted\\nInbd Wing\\nOutbd Wing\\nForeflap Midflap\\nAftflapLeading Edge\\nFlap\\nLeading Edge\\nSlat\\nAileron\\n737\\nLeading\\nEdge Flaps\\nLeading\\nEdge Slats Tab Aileron\\nOutbd\\nFlap\\nFlight\\nSpoilers\\nStabilizer\\nTab\\nElevator\\nRudder\\nInbd Flap\\nGround\\nSpoiler\\n727\\nControl Surfaces\\nFence\\nBalance Tab\\nOutboard Aileron\\nSlats\\nInboard Aileron\\nLeading Edge\\nFlaps\\nGround Spoilers\\nInboard Flaps\\nFlight Spoilers\\nLower Rudder\\nAnti-Balance\\nTabs\\nUpper\\nRudder\\nControl\\nTab\\nElevator\\nStabilizer\\nVortex Generators\\nPitot Tubes\\nOutboard Flap\\nControl Tab\\nFigure 3-47.

The primary control systems consist of\\nthose that are required to safely control an airplane \\nduring flight. These include the ailerons, elevator (or\\nstabilator), and rudder. Secondary control systems\\nimprove the performance characteristics of the \\nairplane, or relieve the pilot of excessive control forces.\\nExamples of secondary control systems are wing flaps\\nand trim systems.\\nPRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROLS\\nAirplane control systems are carefully designed to \\nprovide a natural feel, and at the same time, allow \\nadequate responsiveness to control inputs. At low \\nairspeeds, the controls usually feel soft and sluggish,\\nand the airplane responds slowly to control applications.\\nAt high speeds, the controls feel firm and the response\\nis more rapid.\\nMovement of any of the three primary flight control\\nsurfaces changes the airflow and pressure distribution\\nover and around the airfoil. These changes affect the\\nlift and drag produced by the airfoil/control surface\\ncombination, and allow a pilot to control the airplane\\nabout its three axes of rotation.\\nDesign features limit the amount of deflection of \\nflight control surfaces. For example, control-stop \\nmechanisms may be incorporated into the flight \\ncontrols, or movement of the control column and/or\\nrudder pedals may be limited. The purpose of these\\ndesign limits is to prevent the pilot from inadvertently \\novercontrolling and overstressing the aircraft during\\nnormal  maneuvers.\\nA properly designed airplane should be stable and \\neasily controlled during maneuvering.

Ailerons are connected by cables, \\nbellcranks, pulleys or push-pull tubes to each other \\nand to the control wheel.\\nMoving the control wheel to the right causes the right\\naileron to deflect upward and the left aileron to deflect\\ndownward. The upward deflection of the right aileron\\ndecreases the camber resulting in decreased lift on the\\nright wing. The corresponding downward deflection of\\nthe left aileron increases the camber resulting in\\nincreased lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift\\non the left wing and the decreased lift on the right wing\\ncauses the airplane to roll to the right.\\nADVERSE YAW\\nSince the downward deflected aileron produces more\\nlift, it also produces more drag. This added drag\\nattempts to yaw the airplane’s nose in the direction of\\nthe raised wing. This is called adverse yaw. [Figure 4-2]\\nThe rudder is used to counteract adverse yaw, and the\\namount of rudder control required is greatest at low \\nairspeeds, high angles of attack, and with large aileron\\ndeflections. However, with lower airspeeds, the vertical\\nstabilizer/rudder combination becomes less effective,\\nand magnifies the control problems associated with\\nadverse yaw. \\nAll turns are coordinated by use of ailerons, rudder, and\\nelevator. Applying aileron pressure is necessary to\\nplace the airplane in the desired angle of bank, while\\nsimultaneously applying rudder pressure to counteract\\nthe resultant adverse yaw. During a turn, the angle of\\nattack must be increased by applying elevator pressure\\nbecause more lift is required than when in straight-and-\\nlevel flight. The steeper the turn, the more back \\nelevator pressure is needed. \\nAs the desired angle of bank is established, aileron and\\nrudder pressures should be relaxed. This will stop the\\nbank from increasing because the aileron and rudder\\ncontrol surfaces will be neutral in their streamlined\\nposition. Elevator pressure should be held constant to\\nmaintain a constant altitude. \\nThe rollout from a turn is similar to the roll-in except\\nthe flight controls are applied in the opposite direction.\\nAileron and rudder are applied in the direction of the\\nrollout or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank\\ndecreases, the elevator pressure should be relaxed as\\nnecessary to maintain altitude.\\nDIFFERENTIAL AILERONS\\nWith differential ailerons, one aileron is raised a greater\\ndistance than the other aileron is lowered for a given\\nmovement of the control wheel. This produces an\\nincrease in drag on the descending wing. The \\ngreater drag results from deflecting the up aileron on \\nthe descending wing to a greater angle than the down\\naileron on the rising wing. While adverse yaw is\\nreduced, it is not eliminated completely. [Figure 4-3]\\nFRISE-TYPE AILERONS\\nWith a Frise-type aileron, when pressure is applied to\\nthe control wheel, the aileron that is being raised pivots\\non an offset hinge. This projects the leading edge of the\\naileron into the airflow and creates drag. This helps\\nequalize the drag created by the lowered aileron on the\\nopposite wing and reduces adverse yaw.

Frise-type ailerons\\nalso may be designed to function differentially. Like\\nthe differential aileron, the Frise-type aileron does not\\neliminate adverse yaw entirely. Coordinated rudder\\napplication is still needed wherever ailerons are\\napplied.\\nCOUPLED AILERONS AND RUDDER\\nCoupled ailerons and rudder means these controls are\\nlinked. This is accomplished with rudder-aileron \\ninterconnect springs, which help correct for aileron\\ndrag by automatically deflecting the rudder at the same\\ntime the ailerons are deflected. For example, when the\\ncontrol yoke is moved to produce a left roll, the \\ninterconnect cable and spring pulls forward on the left\\nrudder pedal just enough to prevent the nose of the \\nairplane from yawing to the right. The force applied to\\nthe rudder by the springs can be overridden if it\\nbecomes necessary to slip the airplane. [Figure 4-5]\\nELEVATOR\\nThe elevator controls pitch about the lateral axis. Like\\nthe ailerons on small airplanes, the elevator is \\nconnected to the control column in the cockpit by a\\nseries of mechanical linkages. Aft movement of the\\ncontrol column deflects the trailing edge of the elevator\\nsurface up. This is usually referred to as up elevator.\\n[Figure 4-6]\\nThe up-elevator position decreases the camber of the\\nelevator and creates a downward aerodynamic force,\\nwhich is greater than the normal tail-down force that\\nexists in straight-and-level flight. The overall effect\\ncauses the tail of the airplane to move down and the\\nnose to pitch up. The pitching moment occurs about the\\ncenter of gravity (CG). The strength of the pitching\\nmoment is determined by the distance between the CG\\nand the horizontal tail surface, as well as by the \\naerodynamic effectiveness of the horizontal tail surface.\\nMoving the control column forward has the opposite\\neffect. In this case, elevator camber increases, creating\\nmore lift (less tail-down force) on the horizontal \\nstabilizer/elevator. This moves the tail upward and\\npitches the nose down. Again, the pitching moment\\noccurs about the CG.\\nAs mentioned earlier in the coverage on stability,\\npower, thrustline, and the position of the horizontal tail\\nsurfaces on the empennage are factors in how effective\\nthe elevator is in controlling pitch. For example, the\\nhorizontal tail surfaces may be attached near the lower\\npart of the vertical stabilizer, at the midpoint, or at the\\nhigh point, as in the T-tail design. \\nT-TAIL\\nIn a T-tail configuration, the elevator is above most of\\nthe effects of downwash from the propeller as well as\\nairflow around the fuselage and/or wings during \\nnormal flight conditions. Operation of the elevators in\\nthis undisturbed air makes for control movements that\\nare consistent throughout most flight regimes. T-tail\\ndesigns have become popular on many light airplanes\\nand on large aircraft, especially those with aft-fuselage\\nmounted engines since the T-tail configuration removes\\nthe tail from the exhaust blast of the engines. Seaplanes\\nand amphibians often have T-tails in order to keep the\\nhorizontal surfaces as far from the water as possible.\\nAn additional benefit is reduced vibration and noise\\ninside the aircraft.\\nAt slow speeds, the elevator on a T-tail aircraft must be\\nmoved through a larger number of degrees of travel \\nto raise the nose a given amount as compared \\nto a conventional-tail aircraft.

Since controls on aircraft are rigged in such a\\nmanner as to require increasing control forces for\\nincreased control travel, the forces required to raise the\\nnose of a T-tail aircraft are greater than for a \\nconventional-tail aircraft. Longitudinal stability of a\\ntrimmed aircraft is the same for both types of \\nconfiguration, but the pilot must be aware that at slow\\nspeeds during takeoffs and landings or stalls, the \\ncontrol forces will be greater than for similar size \\nairplanes equipped with conventional tails. \\nT-tail airplanes also require additional design\\nconsiderations to counter the problem of flutter. Since\\nthe weight of the horizontal surfaces is at the top of the\\nvertical stabilizer, the moment arm created causes high\\nloads on the vertical stabilizer which can result in\\nflutter. Engineers must compensate for this by \\nincreasing the design stiffness of the vertical stabilizer,\\nusually resulting in a weight penalty over conventional\\ntail designs.\\nWhen flying at a very high angle of attack with a low\\nairspeed and an aft CG, the T-tail airplane may be \\nsusceptible to a deep stall. In a deep stall, the airflow\\nover the horizontal tail is blanketed by the disturbed\\nairflow from the wings and fuselage. In these \\ncircumstances, elevator or stabilator control could be\\ndiminished, making it difficult to recover from the \\nstall. It should be noted that an aft CG could \\nbe a contributing factor in these incidents since \\nsimilar recovery problems are also found with \\nconventional-tail aircraft with an aft CG. [Figure 4-7]\\nSince flight at a high angle of attack with a low \\nairspeed and an aft CG position can be dangerous,\\nmany airplanes have systems to compensate for this \\nsituation. The systems range from control stops to \\nelevator down springs. An elevator down spring assists\\nin lowering the nose to prevent a stall caused by the aft\\nCG position. The stall occurs because the properly\\ntrimmed airplane is flying with the elevator in a trailing\\nedge down position, forcing the tail up and the nose\\ndown. In this unstable condition, if the airplane\\nencounters turbulence and slows down further, the trim\\ntab no longer positions the elevator in the nose-down\\nposition. The elevator then streamlines, and the nose of\\nthe aircraft pitches upward. This aggravates the \\nsituation and can possibly result in a stall. \\nThe elevator down spring produces a mechanical load\\non the elevator, causing it to move toward the nose-\\ndown position if not otherwise balanced. The elevator\\ntrim tab balances the elevator down spring to position\\nthe elevator in a trimmed position. When the trim tab\\nbecomes ineffective, the down spring drives the \\nelevator to a nose down position. The nose of \\nthe aircraft lowers, speed builds up, and a stall is \\nprevented. [Figure 4-8]\\nThe elevator must also have sufficient authority to hold\\nthe nose of the airplane up during the roundout for a\\nlanding. In this case, a forward CG may cause a \\nproblem. During the landing flare, power normally is\\nreduced, which decreases the airflow over the \\nempennage. This, coupled with the reduced landing\\nspeed, makes the elevator less effective.\\nFrom this discussion, it should be apparent that pilots\\nmust understand and follow proper loading procedures,\\nparticularly with regard to the CG position. More \\ninformation on aircraft loading, as well as weight and\\nbalance, is included in Chapter 8.\\nSTABILATOR\\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, a stabilator is essentially a\\none-piece horizontal stabilizer with the same type of\\ncontrol system. Because stabilators pivot around a \\ncentral hinge point, they are extremely sensitive to \\ncontrol inputs and aerodynamic loads.\\nAntiservo tabs are incorporated on the trailing edge to\\ndecrease sensitivity. In addition, a balance weight is\\nusually incorporated ahead of the main spar. The\\nbalance weight may project into the empennage or may\\nbe incorporated on the forward portion of the\\nstabilator tips. [Figure 4-9]\\nDown Spring Elevator\\nStabilizer\\nFigure 4-8.When the aerodynamic efficiency of the horizontal\\ntail surface is inadequate due to an aft center of gravity con-\\ndition, an elevator down spring may be used to supply a\\nmechanical load to lower the nose.\\nFigure 4-7.

Pushing the control column forward lowers the\\ntrailing edge of the stabilator and pitches the nose of\\nthe airplane down. Without an antiservo tab, the \\nairplane would be prone to overcontrolling from\\npilot-induced control inputs.\\nCANARD\\nThe term canard refers to a control surface that \\nfunctions as a horizontal stabilizer but is located in\\nfront of the main wings. The term also is used to\\ndescribe an airplane equipped with a canard. In effect,\\nit is an airfoil similar to the horizontal surface on \\na conventional aft-tail design. The difference is that the\\ncanard actually creates lift and holds the nose up, as\\nopposed to the aft-tail design which exerts downward\\nforce on the tail to prevent the nose from rotating \\ndownward. [Figure 4-10]\\nAlthough the Wright Flyer was configured as a \\ncanard with the horizontal surfaces in front of the \\nlifting surface, it was not until recently that the\\ncanard configuration began appearing on newer \\nairplanes. Canard designs include two types—one with\\na horizontal surface of about the same size as a normal\\naft-tail design, and the other with a surface of the same\\napproximate size and airfoil of the aft-mounted wing\\nknown as a tandem wing configuration. Theoretically,\\nthe canard is considered more efficient because using\\nthe horizontal surface to help lift the weight of the \\naircraft should result in less drag for a given \\namount of lift. \\nThe canard’s main advantage is in the area of stall \\ncharacteristics. A properly designed canard or tandem\\nwing will run out of authority to raise the nose of the\\naircraft at a point before the main wing will stall. This\\nmakes the aircraft stall-proof and results only in a\\ndescent rate that can be halted by adding power.\\nAilerons on the main wing remain effective throughout\\nthe recovery. Other canard configurations are designed\\nso the canard stalls before the main wing, automatically\\nlowering the nose and recovering the aircraft to a safe\\nflying speed. Again, the ailerons remain effective\\nthroughout the stall. \\nThe canard design has several limitations. First, it is\\nimportant that the forward lifting surface of a canard\\ndesign stalls before the main wing. If the main wing\\nstalls first, the lift remaining from the forward wing or\\ncanard would be well ahead of the CG, and the airplane\\nwould pitch up uncontrollably. Second, when the for-\\nward surface stalls first, or is limited in its ability to\\nincrease the angle of attack, the main wing never\\nreaches a point where its maximum lift is created, \\nsacrificing some performance. Third, use of flaps on\\nthe main wing causes design problems for the forward\\nwing or canard. As lift on the main wing is increased\\nby extension of flaps, the lift requirement of the canard\\nis also increased. The forward wing or canard must be\\nlarge enough to accommodate flap use, but not so large\\nthat it creates more lift than the main wing.\\nFinally, the relationship of the main wing to the \\nforward surface also makes a difference. When \\npositioned closely in the vertical plane, downwash\\nfrom the forward wing can have a negative effect on\\nthe lift of the main wing. Increasing vertical separation\\nincreases efficiency of the design. Efficiency is also\\nincreased as the size of the two surfaces grows closer to\\nbeing equal.\\nRUDDER\\nThe rudder controls movement of the airplane about its\\nvertical axis.

Moving the \\nleft or right rudder pedal controls the rudder. \\nWhen the rudder is deflected into the airflow, a \\nhorizontal force is exerted in the opposite direction.\\n[Figure 4-11]\\nBy pushing the left pedal, the rudder moves left. This\\nalters the airflow around the vertical stabilizer/rudder,\\nand creates a sideward lift that moves the tail to the\\nright and yaws the nose of the airplane to the left.\\nRudder effectiveness increases with speed, so large\\ndeflections at low speeds and small deflections at high\\nspeeds may be required to provide the desired reaction.\\nIn propeller-driven aircraft, any slipstream flowing\\nover the rudder increases its effectiveness.\\nV-TAIL\\nThe V-tail design utilizes two slanted tail surfaces to\\nperform the same functions as the surfaces of a con-\\nventional elevator and rudder configuration. The fixed\\nsurfaces act as both horizontal and vertical stabilizers.\\n[Figure 4-12]\\nThe movable surfaces, which are usually called \\nruddervators, are connected through a special linkage\\nthat allows the control wheel to move both surfaces\\nsimultaneously. On the other hand, displacement of the\\nrudder pedals moves the surfaces differentially, thereby\\nproviding directional control.\\nWhen both rudder and elevator controls are moved by\\nthe pilot, a control mixing mechanism moves each \\nsurface the appropriate amount. The control system for\\nthe V-tail is more complex than that required for a \\nconventional tail. In addition, the V-tail design is more\\nsusceptible to Dutch roll tendencies than a conven-\\ntional tail and total reduction in drag is only minimal. \\nSECONDARY FLIGHT CONTROLS\\nSecondary flight control systems may consist of the\\nflaps, leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim devices.\\nFLAPS\\nFlaps are the most common high-lift devices used on\\npractically all airplanes. These surfaces, which are\\nattached to the trailing edge of the wing, increase both\\nlift and induced drag for any given angle of attack.\\nFlaps allow a compromise between high cruising speed\\nand low landing speed, because they may be extended\\nwhen needed, and retracted into the wing’s structure\\nwhen not needed. There are four common types\\nof flaps: plain, split, slotted, and Fowler flaps.\\n[Figure 4-13]\\nThe plain flap is the simplest of the four types. It\\nincreases the airfoil camber, resulting in a significant\\nincrease in the coefficient of lift at a given angle of\\nattack. At the same time, it greatly increases drag and\\nmoves the center of pressure aft on the airfoil, resulting\\nin a nose-down pitching moment.\\nRuddervator—A pair of control surfaces on the tail of an aircraft\\narranged in the form of a V .

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='4-7\\nThe split flap is deflected from the lower surface of the\\nairfoil and produces a slightly greater increase in lift\\nthan does the plain flap. However, more drag is created\\nbecause of the turbulent air pattern produced behind\\nthe airfoil. When fully extended, both plain and split\\nflaps produce high drag with little additional lift. \\nThe most popular flap on airplanes today is the slotted\\nflap. Variations of this design are used for small \\nairplanes as well as for large ones. Slotted flaps\\nincrease the lift coefficient significantly more than\\nplain or spilt flaps. On small airplanes, the hinge is\\nlocated below the lower surface of the flap, and when\\nthe flap is lowered, it forms a duct between the flap\\nwell in the wing and the leading edge of the flap.\\nWhen the slotted flap is lowered, high-energy air from\\nthe lower surface is ducted to the flap’s upper surface.\\nThe high-energy air from the slot accelerates the upper\\nsurface boundary layer and delays airflow separation,\\nproviding a higher coefficient of lift. Thus, the slotted\\nflap produces much greater increases in C\\nLmax than the\\nplain or split flap. While there are many types of \\nslotted flaps, large airplanes often have double- and even\\ntriple-slotted flaps. These allow the maximum increase in\\ndrag without the airflow over the flaps separating and\\ndestroying the lift they produce. \\nFowler flaps are a type of slotted flap. This flap design\\nnot only changes the camber of the wing, it also\\nincreases the wing area. Instead of rotating down on a\\nhinge, it slides backwards on tracks. In the first portion\\nof its extension, it increases the drag very little, but\\nincreases the lift a great deal as it increases both the\\narea and camber. As the extension continues, the flap\\ndeflects downward, and during the last portion of its\\ntravel, it increases the drag with little additional\\nincrease in lift.\\nLEADING EDGE DEVICES\\nHigh-lift devices also can be applied to the leading edge\\nof the airfoil. The most common types are fixed slots,\\nmovable slats, and leading edge flaps. [Figure 4-14]\\nFixed slots direct airflow to the upper wing surface and\\ndelay airflow separation at higher angles of attack. The\\nslot does not increase the wing camber, but allows a\\nhigher maximum coefficient of lift because the stall is\\ndelayed until the wing reaches a greater angle of attack. \\nMovable slats consist of leading edge segments, which\\nmove on tracks. At low angles of attack, each slat \\nis held flush against the wing’s leading edge by the high\\npressure that forms at the wing’s leading edge. As the\\nangle of attack increases, the high-pressure area moves\\naft below the lower surface of the wing, allowing \\nthe slats to move forward. Some slats, however, are\\npilot operated and can be deployed at any angle of\\nattack. Opening a slat allows the air below the wing\\nto flow over the wing’s upper surface, delaying \\nairflow separation. \\nLeading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, are used to\\nincrease both C\\nLmax and the camber of the wings. This\\ntype of leading edge device is frequently used in \\nconjunction with trailing edge flaps and can reduce the\\nnose-down pitching movement produced by the latter.\\nAs is true with trailing edge flaps, a small increment of\\nleading edge flaps increases lift to a much greater\\nextent than drag. As greater amounts of flaps are\\nextended, drag increases at a greater rate than lift. \\nSPOILERS\\nOn some airplanes, high-drag devices called spoilers\\nare deployed from the wings to spoil the smooth \\nairflow, reducing lift and increasing drag. Spoilers are\\nused for roll control on some aircraft, one of the\\nadvantages being the elimination of adverse yaw. To\\nturn right, for example, the spoiler on the right wing is\\nraised, destroying some of the lift and creating more\\ndrag on the right. The right wing drops, and the airplane\\nbanks and yaws to the right. Deploying spoilers on both\\nwings at the same time allows the aircraft to descend\\nwithout gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed to\\nhelp shorten ground roll after landing. By destroying\\nlift, they transfer weight to the wheels, improving \\nbraking effectiveness.

Trim systems usually consist of cockpit \\ncontrols and small hinged devices attached to the \\ntrailing edge of one or more of the primary flight \\ncontrol surfaces. They are designed to help minimize \\na pilot’s workload by aerodynamically assisting \\nmovement and position of the flight control surface to\\nwhich they are attached. Common types of trim \\nsystems include trim tabs, balance tabs, antiservo \\ntabs, ground adjustable tabs, and an adjustable \\nstabilizer.\\nTRIM TABS\\nThe most common installation on small airplanes is a\\nsingle trim tab attached to the trailing edge of the \\nelevator. Most trim tabs are manually operated by a\\nsmall, vertically mounted control wheel. However, \\na trim crank may be found in some airplanes. The \\ncockpit control includes a tab position indicator.\\nPlacing the trim control in the full nose-down \\nposition moves the tab to its full up position. With the\\ntab up and into the airstream, the airflow over the \\nhorizontal tail surface tends to force the trailing edge of\\nthe elevator down. This causes the tail of the airplane\\nto move up, and results in a nose-down pitch change.\\n[Figure 4-16]\\nIf you set the trim tab to the full nose-up position, the\\ntab moves to its full-down position. In this case, the air\\nflowing under the horizontal tail surface hits the tab\\nand tends to force the trailing edge of the elevator up,\\nreducing the elevator’s angle of attack. This causes a\\ntail-down movement of the airplane and a nose-up\\npitch change.\\nIn spite of the opposite direction movement of the trim\\ntab and the elevator, control of trim is natural to a pilot.\\nIf you have to exert constant back pressure on the \\ncontrol column, the need for nose-up trim is indicated.\\nThe normal trim procedure is to continue trimming\\nuntil the airplane is balanced and the nose-heavy \\ncondition is no longer apparent. Pilots normally \\nestablish the desired power, pitch attitude, and\\nconfiguration first, and then trim the airplane to relieve\\ncontrol pressures that may exist for that flight \\ncondition. Any time power, pitch attitude, or\\nconfiguration is changed, expect that retrimming will\\nbe necessary to relieve the control pressures for the\\nnew flight condition.\\nBALANCE TABS\\nThe control forces may be excessively high in \\nsome airplanes, and in order to decrease them, the \\nmanufacturer may use balance tabs. They look like trim\\ntabs and are hinged in approximately the same places\\nas trim tabs. The essential difference between the two\\nis that the balancing tab is coupled to the control \\nsurface rod so that when the primary control surface is\\nmoved in any direction, the tab automatically moves in\\nthe opposite direction. In this manner, the airflow \\nstriking the tab counter-balances some of the air \\npressure against the primary control surface, and\\nenables the pilot to more easily move and hold the \\ncontrol surface in position.\\nIf the linkage between the tab and the fixed surface is\\nadjustable from the cockpit, the tab acts as a \\ncombination trim and balance tab, which can be\\nadjusted to any desired deflection. Any time the control\\nsurface is deflected, the tab moves in the opposite\\ndirection and eases the load on the pilot. \\nANTISERVO TABS\\nIn addition to decreasing the sensitivity of the \\nstabilator, an antiservo tab also functions as a trim\\ndevice to relieve control pressure and maintain the \\nstabilator in the desired position. The fixed end of \\nthe linkage is on the opposite side of the surface \\nfrom the horn on the tab, and when the trailing edge of\\nthe stabilator moves up, the linkage forces the trailing\\nedge of the tab up. When the stabilator moves down,\\nthe tab also moves down. This is different than trim\\ntabs on elevators, which move opposite of the control \\nsurface. [Figure 4-17]\\nNose-Down Trim\\nNose-Up Trim\\nTab Up; Elevator Down\\nTab Down; Elevator Up\\nFigure 4-16. The movement of the elevator is opposite to the\\ndirection of movement of the elevator trim tab.\\nCh 04.qxd  10/24/03  6:47 AM  Page 4-8'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='4-9\\nThis tab works in the same manner as the balance tab\\nexcept that, instead of moving in the opposite direc-\\ntion, it moves in the same direction as the trailing edge\\nof the stabilator. For example, when the trailing edge\\nof the stabilator moves up, the linkage forces the \\ntrailing edge of the tab up. When the stabilator moves\\ndown, the tab also moves down. \\nGROUND ADJUSTABLE TABS\\nMany small airplanes have a non-moveable metal trim\\ntab on the rudder. This tab is bent in one direction or\\nthe other while on the ground to apply a trim force to\\nthe rudder. The correct displacement is determined by\\ntrial-and-error process. Usually, small adjustments are\\nnecessary until you are satisfied that the airplane is no\\nlonger skidding left or right during normal cruising\\nflight. [Figure 4-18]\\nADJUSTABLE STABILIZER\\nRather than using a movable tab on the trailing edge of\\nthe elevator, some airplanes have an adjustable \\nstabilizer. With this arrangement, linkages pivot \\nthe horizontal stabilizer about its rear spar. This is\\naccomplished by use of a jackscrew mounted on the\\nleading edge of the stabilator. [Figure 4-19]\\nOn small airplanes, the jackscrew is cable-operated\\nwith a trim wheel or crank, and on larger airplanes, \\nit is motor driven. The trimming effect and cockpit\\nindications for an adjustable stabilizer are similar to\\nthose of a trim tab.\\nSince the primary and secondary flight control \\nsystems vary extensively between aircraft, you need to\\nbe familiar with the systems in your aircraft.

The name is derived from the back-and-forth,\\nor reciprocating, movement of the pistons. It is this\\nmotion that produces the mechanical energy needed to\\naccomplish work. Two common means of classifying\\nreciprocating engines are:\\n1. by cylinder arrangement with respect to the\\ncrankshaft—radial, in-line, v-type or opposed, or\\n2. by the method of cooling—liquid or air-cooled.\\nRadial engines were widely used during World War II,\\nand many are still in service today. With these engines,\\na row or rows of cylinders are arranged in a circular\\npattern around the crankcase. The main advantage of a\\nradial engine is the favorable power-to-weight ratio.\\nIn-line engines have a comparatively small frontal area,\\nbut their power-to-weight ratios are relatively low. In\\naddition, the rearmost cylinders of an air-cooled,\\nin-line engine receive very little cooling air, so these\\nengines are normally limited to four or six cylinders.\\nV-type engines provide more horsepower than in-line\\nengines and still retain a small frontal area. Further\\nimprovements in engine design led to the development\\nof the horizontally-opposed engine.\\nOpposed-type engines are the most popular reciprocat-\\ning engines used on small airplanes. These engines\\nalways have an even number of cylinders, since a\\ncylinder on one side of the crankcase “opposes” a\\ncylinder on the other side. The majority of these\\nengines are air cooled and usually are mounted in a\\nhorizontal position when installed on fixed-wing\\nairplanes. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-\\nweight ratios because they have a comparatively small,\\nlightweight crankcase.

[Figure 5-1] The\\nmagnetos are normally located on the engine accessory\\nhousing.\\nThe basic principle for reciprocating engines involves\\nthe conversion of chemical energy, in the form of fuel,\\ninto mechanical energy. This occurs within the\\ncylinders of the engine through a process known as the\\nfour-stroke operating cycle. These strokes are called\\nintake, compression, power, and exhaust. [Figure 5-2]\\n1. The intake stroke begins as the piston starts its\\ndownward travel. When this happens, the intake\\nvalve opens and the fuel/air mixture is drawn into\\nthe cylinder.\\n2. The compression stroke begins when the intake\\nvalve closes and the piston starts moving back to\\nthe top of the cylinder. This phase of the cycle is\\nused to obtain a much greater power output from\\nthe fuel/air mixture once it is ignited.\\n3. The power stroke begins when the fuel/air\\nmixture is ignited. This causes a tremendous\\npressure increase in the cylinder, and forces the\\npiston downward away from the cylinder head,\\ncreating the power that turns the crankshaft.\\n4. The exhaust stroke is used to purge the cylinder\\nof burned gases. It begins when the exhaust valve\\nopens and the piston starts to move toward the\\ncylinder head once again.\\nEven when the engine is operated at a fairly low speed,\\nthe four-stroke cycle takes place several hundred times\\neach minute. In a four-cylinder engine, each cylinder\\noperates on a different stroke. Continuous rotation of a\\ncrankshaft is maintained by the precise timing of the\\npower strokes in each cylinder.

The amount of thrust\\nproduced depends on the shape of the airfoil, the angle\\nof attack of the propeller blade, and the r.p.m. of the\\nengine. The propeller itself is twisted so the blade angle\\nchanges from hub to tip. The greatest angle of\\nincidence, or the highest pitch, is at the hub while the\\nsmallest pitch is at the tip. [Figure 5-3]\\nThe reason for the twist is to produce uniform lift from\\nthe hub to the tip. As the blade rotates, there is a\\ndifference in the actual speed of the various portions of\\nthe blade. The tip of the blade travels faster than that\\npart near the hub, because the tip travels a greater\\ndistance than the hub in the same length of time.\\nChanging the angle of incidence (pitch) from the hub\\nto the tip to correspond with the speed produces\\nuniform lift throughout the length of the blade. If the\\npropeller blade was designed with the same angle of\\nincidence throughout its entire length, it would be\\ninefficient, because as airspeed increases in flight, the\\nportion near the hub would have a negative angle of\\nattack while the blade tip would be stalled. [Figure 5-4]\\nSmall airplanes are equipped with either one of two\\ntypes of propellers. One is the fixed-pitch, and the other\\nis the controllable-pitch.\\nFIXED-PITCH PROPELLER\\nThe pitch of this propeller is set by the manufacturer,\\nand cannot be changed. With this type of propeller, the\\nbest efficiency is achieved only at a given combination\\nof airspeed and r.p.m.\\nThere are two types of fixed-pitch propellers—the\\nclimb propeller and the cruise propeller. Whether the\\nairplane has a climb or cruise propeller installed\\ndepends upon its intended use:\\n• The climb propeller has a lower pitch, therefore\\nless drag. Less drag results in higher r.p.m. and\\nmore horsepower capability, which increases\\nperformance during takeoffs and climbs, but\\ndecreases performance during cruising flight.\\n• The cruise propeller has a higher pitch, therefore\\nmore drag. More drag results in lower r.p.m. and\\nless horsepower capability, which decreases\\nperformance during takeoffs and climbs, but\\nincreases efficiency during cruising flight.\\nThe propeller is usually mounted on a shaft, which may\\nbe an extension of the engine crankshaft. In this case,\\nthe r.p.m. of the propeller would be the same as the\\ncrankshaft r.p.m. On some engines, the propeller is\\nmounted on a shaft geared to the engine crankshaft.

For\\nexample, 2,300 r.p.m. at 5,000 feet produce less\\nhorsepower than 2,300 r.p.m. at sea level. The reason\\nfor this is that power output depends on air density. Air\\ndensity decreases as altitude increases. Therefore, a\\ndecrease in air density (higher density altitude)\\ndecreases the power output of the engine. As altitude\\nchanges, the position of the throttle must be changed to\\nmaintain the same r.p.m. As altitude is increased, the\\nthrottle must be opened further to indicate the same\\nr.p.m. as at a lower altitude.\\nADJUSTABLE-PITCH PROPELLER\\nAlthough some older adjustable-pitch propellers could\\nonly be adjusted on the ground, most modern\\nadjustable-pitch propellers are designed so that you can\\nchange the propeller pitch in flight. The first\\nadjustable-pitch propeller systems provided only two\\npitch settings \\uf8e7a low-pitch setting and a high-pitch\\nsetting. Today, however, nearly all adjustable-pitch\\npropeller systems are capable of a range of\\npitch settings.\\nA constant-speed propeller is the most common type of\\nadjustable-pitch propeller. The main advantage of a\\nconstant-speed propeller is that it converts a high\\npercentage of brake horsepower (BHP) into thrust\\nhorsepower (THP) over a wide range of r.p.m. and\\nairspeed combinations. A constant-speed propeller is\\nmore efficient than other propellers because it allows\\nselection of the most efficient engine r.p.m. for the\\ngiven conditions.\\nAn airplane with a constant-speed propeller has two\\ncontrols—the throttle and the propeller control. The\\nthrottle controls power output, and the propeller\\ncontrol regulates engine r.p.m. and, in turn, propeller\\nr.p.m., which is registered on the tachometer.\\nOnce a specific r.p.m. is selected, a governor\\nautomatically adjusts the propeller blade angle as\\nnecessary to maintain the selected r.p.m. For example,\\nafter setting the desired r.p.m. during cruising flight, an\\nincrease in airspeed or decrease in propeller load will\\ncause the propeller blade angle to increase as necessary\\nto maintain the selected r.p.m. A reduction in airspeed\\nor increase in propeller load will cause the propeller\\nblade angle to decrease.\\nThe range of possible blade angles for a constant-speed\\npropeller is the propeller’s constant-speed range and is\\ndefined by the high and low pitch stops. As long as the\\npropeller blade angle is within the constant-speed range\\nand not against either pitch stop, a constant engine\\nr.p.m. will be maintained. However, once the propeller\\nblades contact a pitch stop, the engine r.p.m. will\\nincrease or decrease as appropriate, with changes in\\nairspeed and propeller load. For example, once a\\nspecific r.p.m. has been selected, if aircraft speed\\ndecreases enough to rotate the propeller blades until\\nthey contact the low pitch stop, any further decrease in\\nairspeed will cause engine r.p.m. to decrease the same\\nway as if a fixed-pitch propeller were installed. The\\nsame holds true when an airplane equipped with a\\nconstant-speed propeller accelerates to a faster\\nairspeed. As the aircraft accelerates, the propeller blade\\nangle increases to maintain the selected r.p.m. until the\\nhigh pitch stop is reached. Once this occurs, the blade\\nangle cannot increase any further and engine\\nr.p.m. increases.\\nOn airplanes that are equipped with a constant-speed\\npropeller, power output is controlled by the throttle and\\nindicated by a manifold pressure gauge. The gauge\\nmeasures the absolute pressure of the fuel/air mixture\\ninside the intake manifold and is more correctly a\\nmeasure of manifold absolute pressure (MAP) . At a\\nconstant r.p.m. and altitude, the amount of power\\nproduced is directly related to the fuel/air flow being\\ndelivered to the combustion chamber. As you increase\\nthe throttle setting, more fuel and air is flowing to the\\nengine; therefore, MAP increases. When the engine is\\nnot running, the manifold pressure gauge indicates\\nambient air pressure (i.e., 29.92 in. Hg). When the\\nengine is started, the manifold pressure indication will\\ndecrease to a value less than ambient pressure (i.e., idle\\nat 12 in. Hg). Correspondingly, engine failure or power\\nloss is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase\\nin manifold pressure to a value corresponding to the\\nambient air pressure at the altitude where the failure\\noccurred. [Figure 5-6]\\nThe manifold pressure gauge is color-coded to indicate\\nthe engine’s operating range. The face of the manifold\\npressure gauge contains a green arc to show the normal\\noperating range, and a red radial line to indicate the\\nupper limit of manifold pressure.\\nFor any given r.p.m., there is a manifold pressure that\\nshould not be exceeded. If manifold pressure is\\nexcessive for a given r.p.m., the pressure within the\\ncylinders could be exceeded, thus placing undue stress\\non the cylinders. If repeated too frequently, this stress\\ncould weaken the cylinder components, and eventually\\ncause engine failure.\\nManifold Absolute Pressure (MAP)—The absolute pressure of the\\nfuel/air mixture within the intake manifold, usually indicated in inches\\nof mercury.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-4'),\n",

Outside air\\nenters the induction system through an intake port on\\nthe front of the engine cowling. This port normally con-\\ntains an air filter that inhibits the entry of dust and other\\nforeign objects. Since the filter may occasionally\\nbecome clogged, an alternate source of air must be\\navailable. Usually, the alternate air comes from inside\\nthe engine cowling, where it bypasses a clogged\\nair filter. Some alternate air sources function\\nautomatically, while others operate manually.\\nTwo types of induction systems are commonly used in\\nsmall airplane engines:\\n1. the carburetor system, which mixes the fuel and\\nair in the carburetor before this mixture enters the\\nintake manifold, and\\n2. the fuel injection system, which mixes the fuel\\nand air just before entry into each cylinder.\\nCARBURETOR SYSTEMS\\nCarburetors are classified as either float-type or\\npressure-type. Pressure carburetors are usually not\\nfound on small airplanes. The basic difference between\\na pressure carburetor and a float-type is the pressure\\ncarburetor delivers fuel under pressure by a fuel pump.\\nIn the operation of the float-type carburetor system, the\\noutside air first flows through an air filter, usually\\nlocated at an air intake in the front part of the engine\\ncowling. This filtered air flows into the carburetor and\\nthrough a venturi, a narrow throat in the carburetor.\\nWhen the air flows through the venturi, a low-pressure\\narea is created, which forces the fuel to flow through a\\nmain fuel jet located at the throat. The fuel then flows\\ninto the airstream, where it is mixed with the flowing\\nair. See figure 5-7 on page 5-6.\\nThe fuel/air mixture is then drawn through the intake\\nmanifold and into the combustion chambers, where it is\\nignited. The “float-type carburetor” acquires its name\\nfrom a float, which rests on fuel within the float\\nchamber. A needle attached to the float opens and\\ncloses an opening at the bottom of the carburetor bowl.\\nThis meters the correct amount of fuel into the\\ncarburetor, depending upon the position of the float,\\nwhich is controlled by the level of fuel in the float\\nchamber. When the level of the fuel forces the float to\\nrise, the needle valve closes the fuel opening and shuts\\noff the fuel flow to the carburetor. The needle valve\\nopens again when the engine requires additional fuel.\\nThe flow of the fuel/air mixture to the combustion\\nchambers is regulated by the throttle valve, which is\\ncontrolled by the throttle in the cockpit.\\nMIXTURE CONTROL\\nCarburetors are normally calibrated at sea-level\\npressure, where the correct fuel-to-air mixture ratio is\\nestablished with the mixture control set in the FULL\\nRICH position. However, as altitude increases, the\\ndensity of air entering the carburetor decreases, while\\nthe density of the fuel remains the same. This creates a\\nFigure 5-6.

The\\nroughness normally is due to spark plug fouling from\\nexcessive carbon buildup on the plugs. Carbon buildup\\noccurs because the excessively rich mixture lowers the\\ntemperature inside the cylinder, inhibiting complete\\ncombustion of the fuel. This condition may occur\\nduring the pretakeoff runup at high-elevation airports\\nand during climbs or cruise flight at high altitudes. To\\nmaintain the correct fuel/air mixture, you must lean the\\nmixture using the mixture control. Leaning the mixture\\ndecreases fuel flow, which compensates for the\\ndecreased air density at high altitude.\\nDuring a descent from high altitude, the opposite is\\ntrue. The mixture must be enriched, or it may become\\ntoo lean. An overly lean mixture causes detonation,\\nwhich may result in rough engine operation,\\noverheating, and a loss of power. The best way to\\nmaintain the proper mixture is to monitor the engine\\ntemperature and enrichen the mixture as needed.\\nProper mixture control and better fuel economy for\\nfuel-injected engines can be achieved by use of an\\nexhaust gas temperature gauge. Since the process of\\nadjusting the mixture can vary from one airplane to\\nanother, it is important to refer to the Airplane Flight\\nManual (AFM) or the Pilot’s Operating Handbook\\n(POH) to determine the specific procedures for a\\ngiven airplane.\\nCARBURETOR ICING\\nOne disadvantage of the float-type carburetor is its\\nicing tendency. Carburetor ice occurs due to the effect\\nof fuel vaporization and the decrease in air pressure in\\nthe venturi, which causes a sharp temperature drop in\\nthe carburetor. If water vapor in the air condenses when\\nthe carburetor temperature is at or below freezing, ice\\nmay form on internal surfaces of the carburetor,\\nincluding the throttle valve.

Ice generally forms in the vicinity of the\\nthrottle valve and in the venturi throat. This restricts\\nthe flow of the fuel/air mixture and reduces power. If\\nenough ice builds up, the engine may cease to operate.\\nCarburetor ice is most likely to occur when\\ntemperatures are below 70°F (21°C) and the relative\\nhumidity is above 80 percent. However, due to the\\nsudden cooling that takes place in the carburetor, icing\\ncan occur even with temperatures as high as 100°F\\n(38°C) and humidity as low as 50 percent. This\\ntemperature drop can be as much as 60 to 70°F.\\nTherefore, at an outside air temperature of 100°F, a\\ntemperature drop of 70°F results in an air temperature\\nin the carburetor of 30°F. [Figure 5-9]\\nThe first indication of carburetor icing in an airplane\\nwith a fixed-pitch propeller is a decrease in engine\\nr.p.m., which may be followed by engine roughness. In\\nan airplane with a constant-speed propeller, carburetor\\nicing usually is indicated by a decrease in manifold\\npressure, but no reduction in r.p.m. Propeller pitch is\\nautomatically adjusted to compensate for loss of\\npower. Thus, a constant r.p.m. is maintained. Although\\ncarburetor ice can occur during any phase of flight, it is\\nparticularly dangerous when using reduced power\\nduring a descent. Under certain conditions, carburetor\\nice could build unnoticed until you try to add power. To\\ncombat the effects of carburetor ice, engines with\\nfloat-type carburetors employ a carburetor heat system.\\nCARBURETOR HEAT\\nCarburetor heat is an anti-icing system that preheats\\nthe air before it reaches the carburetor. Carburetor heat\\nis intended to keep the fuel/air mixture above the\\nfreezing temperature to prevent the formation\\nof carburetor ice. Carburetor heat can be used to melt\\nice that has already formed in the carburetor\\nprovided that the accumulation is not too great. The\\nemphasis, however, is on using carburetor heat as a\\npreventative measure.\\nThe carburetor heat should be checked during the\\nengine runup. When using carburetor heat, follow the\\nmanufacturer’s recommendations.\\nWhen conditions are conducive to carburetor icing\\nduring flight, periodic checks should be made to detect\\nits presence. If detected, full carburetor heat should be\\napplied immediately, and it should be left in the ON\\nposition until you are certain that all the ice has been\\nremoved. If ice is present, applying partial heat or\\nleaving heat on for an insufficient time might aggravate\\nthe situation. In extreme cases of carburetor icing, even\\nafter the ice has been removed, full carburetor heat\\nshould be used to prevent further ice formation. A\\ncarburetor temperature gauge, if installed, is very\\nuseful in determining when to use carburetor heat.\\nWhenever the throttle is closed during flight, the\\nengine cools rapidly and vaporization of the fuel is less\\ncomplete than if the engine is warm. Also, in this\\ncondition, the engine is more susceptible to carburetor\\nicing. Therefore, if you suspect carburetor icing\\nconditions and anticipate closed-throttle operation,\\nadjust the carburetor heat to the full ON position before\\nclosing the throttle, and leave it on during the\\nclosed-throttle operation. The heat will aid in\\nvaporizing the fuel, and help prevent the formation of\\ncarburetor ice. Periodically, open the throttle smoothly\\nfor a few seconds to keep the engine warm, otherwise\\nthe carburetor heater may not provide enough heat to\\nprevent icing.\\nThe use of carburetor heat causes a decrease in engine\\npower, sometimes up to 15 percent, because the heated\\nair is less dense than the outside air that had been\\nentering the engine. This enriches the mixture. When\\nice is present in an airplane with a fixed-pitch propeller\\nand carburetor heat is being used, there is a decrease in\\nr.p.m., followed by a gradual increase in r.p.m. as the\\nice melts. The engine also should run more smoothly\\nafter the ice has been removed. If ice is not present, the\\nr.p.m. will decrease, then remain constant. When\\ncarburetor heat is used on an airplane with a\\nconstant-speed propeller, and ice is present, a decrease\\nin the manifold pressure will be noticed, followed by a\\ngradual increase. If carburetor icing is not present, the\\ngradual increase in manifold pressure will not be\\napparent until the carburetor heat is turned off.\\nIt is imperative that a pilot recognizes carburetor ice\\nwhen it forms during flight. In addition, a loss of\\npower, altitude, and/or airspeed will occur. These\\nsymptoms may sometimes be accompanied by\\nvibration or engine roughness.

This is accomplished by\\napplying full carburetor heat, which will cause a\\nfurther reduction in power, and possibly engine\\nroughness as melted ice goes through the engine. These\\nsymptoms may last from 30 seconds to several\\nminutes, depending on the severity of the icing. During\\nthis period, the pilot must resist the temptation to\\ndecrease the carburetor heat usage. Carburetor heat\\nmust remain in the full-hot position until normal\\npower returns.\\nSince the use of carburetor heat tends to reduce the\\noutput of the engine and also to increase the operating\\ntemperature, carburetor heat should not be used when\\nfull power is required (as during takeoff) or during\\nnormal engine operation, except to check for the\\npresence or to remove carburetor ice.\\nCARBURETOR AIR TEMPERATURE GAUGE\\nSome airplanes are equipped with a carburetor air\\ntemperature gauge, which is useful in detecting\\npotential icing conditions. Usually, the face of the\\ngauge is calibrated in degrees Celsius ( °C), with a\\nyellow arc indicating the carburetor air temperatures\\nwhere icing may occur. This yellow arc typically\\nranges between -15°C and +5°C (5°F and 41°F). If the\\nair temperature and moisture content of the air are such\\nthat carburetor icing is improbable, the engine can be\\noperated with the indicator in the yellow range with no\\nadverse effects. However, if the atmospheric conditions\\nare conducive to carburetor icing, the indicator must be\\nkept outside the yellow arc by application of\\ncarburetor heat.\\nCertain carburetor air temperature gauges have a red\\nradial, which indicates the maximum permissible\\ncarburetor inlet air temperature recommended by the\\nengine manufacturer; also, a green arc may be included\\nto indicate the normal operating range.\\nOUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE GAUGE\\nMost airplanes also are equipped with an outside air\\ntemperature (OAT) gauge calibrated in both degrees\\nCelsius and Fahrenheit. It provides the outside or\\nambient air temperature for calculating true\\nairspeed, and also is useful in detecting potential\\nicing conditions.\\nFUEL INJECTION SYSTEMS\\nIn a fuel injection system, the fuel is injected either\\ndirectly into the cylinders, or just ahead of the intake\\nvalve. A fuel injection system is considered to be less\\nsusceptible to icing than the carburetor system. Impact\\nicing on the air intake, however, is a possibility in\\neither system. Impact icing occurs when ice forms on\\nthe exterior of the airplane, and blocks openings such\\nas the air intake for the injection system.\\nThe air intake for the fuel injection system is similar to\\nthat used in the carburetor system, with an alternate air\\nsource located within the engine cowling. This source\\nis used if the external air source is obstructed. The\\nalternate air source is usually operated automatically,\\nwith a backup manual system that can be used if the\\nautomatic feature malfunctions.\\nA fuel injection system usually incorporates these basic\\ncomponents—an engine-driven fuel pump, a fuel/air\\ncontrol unit, fuel manifold (fuel distributor), discharge\\nnozzles, an auxiliary fuel pump, and fuel pressure/flow\\nindicators. [Figure 5-10]\\nThe auxiliary fuel pump provides fuel under pressure\\nto the fuel/air control unit for engine starting and/or\\nemergency use. After starting, the engine-driven fuel\\npump provides fuel under pressure from the fuel tank\\nto the fuel/air control unit. This control unit, which\\nessentially replaces the carburetor, meters fuel based\\non the mixture control setting, and sends it to the fuel\\nmanifold valve at a rate controlled by the throttle. After\\nreaching the fuel manifold valve, the fuel is distributed\\nto the individual fuel discharge nozzles. The discharge\\nnozzles, which are located in each cylinder head, inject\\nthe fuel/air mixture directly into each cylinder\\nintake port.\\nSome of the advantages of fuel injection are:\\n• Reduction in evaporative icing.\\n• Better fuel flow.\\n• Faster throttle response.\\n• Precise control of mixture.\\n• Better fuel distribution.\\n• Easier cold weather starts.\\nFuel\\nManifold\\nValve\\nFuel\\nDischarge\\nNozzle\\nFuel/Air\\nControl\\nUnit\\nEngine-Driven\\nFuel Pump\\nFuel Tank\\nAuxiliary\\nFuel Pump\\nFigure 5-10.

Airplanes with these systems have a manifold\\npressure gauge, which displays manifold absolute\\npressure (MAP) within the engine’s intake manifold.\\nOn a standard day at sea level with the engine shut\\ndown, the manifold pressure gauge will indicate the\\nambient absolute air pressure of 29.92 in. Hg. Because\\natmospheric pressure decreases approximately 1 in. Hg\\nper 1,000 feet of altitude increase, the manifold\\npressure gauge will indicate approximately 24.92 in.\\nHg at an airport that is 5,000 feet above sea level with\\nstandard day conditions.\\nAs a normally aspirated aircraft climbs, it eventually\\nreaches an altitude where the MAP is insufficient for a\\nnormal climb. That altitude limit is the aircraft’s\\nservice ceiling , and it is directly affected by the\\nengine’s ability to produce power. If the induction air\\nentering the engine is pressurized, or boosted, by either\\na supercharger or a turbosupercharger, the aircraft’s\\nservice ceiling can be increased. With these systems,\\nyou can fly at higher altitudes with the advantage of\\nhigher true airspeeds and the increased ability to\\ncircumnavigate adverse weather.\\nSUPERCHARGERS\\nA supercharger is an engine-driven air pump or\\ncompressor that increases manifold pressure and forces\\nthe fuel/air mixture into the cylinders. The higher the\\nmanifold pressure, the more dense the fuel/air mixture,\\nand the more power an engine can produce. With a\\nnormally aspirated engine, it is not possible to have\\nmanifold pressure higher than the existing atmospheric\\npressure. A supercharger is capable of boosting\\nmanifold pressure above 30 in. Hg.\\nThe components in a supercharged induction system\\nare similar to those in a normally aspirated system, with\\nthe addition of a supercharger between the fuel\\nmetering device and intake manifold. A supercharger is\\ndriven by the engine through a gear train at one speed,\\ntwo speeds, or variable speeds. In addition,\\nsuperchargers can have one or more stages. Each stage\\nprovides an increase in pressure. Therefore,\\nsuperchargers may be classified as single stage, two\\nstage, or multistage, depending on the number of times\\ncompression occurs.\\nAn early version of a single-stage, single-speed\\nsupercharger may be referred to as a sea-level\\nsupercharger. An engine equipped with this type of\\nsupercharger is called a sea-level engine . With this\\ntype of supercharger, a single gear-driven impeller is\\nused to increase the power produced by an engine at all\\naltitudes. The drawback, however, is that with this type\\nof supercharger, engine power output still decreases\\nwith an increase in altitude, in the same way that it does\\nwith a normally aspirated engine.\\nSingle-stage, single-speed superchargers are found on\\nmany high-powered radial engines, and use an air\\nintake that faces forward so the induction system can\\ntake full advantage of the ram air. Intake air passes\\nthrough ducts to a carburetor, where fuel is metered in\\nproportion to the airflow. The fuel/air charge is then\\nducted to the supercharger, or blower impeller, which\\naccelerates the fuel/air mixture outward. Once\\naccelerated, the fuel/air mixture passes through a\\ndiffuser, where air velocity is traded for pressure\\nenergy. After compression, the resulting high pressure\\nfuel/air mixture is directed to the cylinders.\\nSome of the large radial engines developed during\\nWorld War II have a single-stage, two-speed\\nsupercharger. With this type of supercharger, a single\\nimpeller may be operated at two speeds. The low\\nimpeller speed is often referred to as the low blower\\nsetting, while the high impeller speed is called the high\\nblower setting. On engines equipped with a two-speed\\nsupercharger, a lever or switch in the cockpit activates\\nan oil-operated clutch that switches from one speed to\\nthe other.\\nUnder normal operations, takeoff is made with the\\nsupercharger in the low blower position. In this mode,\\nthe engine performs as a ground-boosted engine, and\\nthe power output decreases as the aircraft gains\\naltitude. However, once the aircraft reaches a specified\\naltitude, a power reduction is made, and the\\nsupercharger control is switched to the high blower\\nposition. The throttle is then reset to the desired\\nService Ceiling—The maximum density altitude where the best rate-of-\\nclimb airspeed will produce a 100 feet-per-minute climb at maximum\\nweight while in a clean configuration with maximum continuous power.\\nSupercharger—An engine-driven air compressor used to provide\\nadditional pressure to the induction air so the engine can produce addi-\\ntional power.\\nSea-Level Engine—A reciprocating aircraft engine having a rated\\ntakeoff power that is producible only at sea level.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-9'),\n",

An engine equipped with this type\\nof supercharger is called an altitude engine .\\n[Figure 5-11]\\nTURBOSUPERCHARGERS\\nThe most efficient method of increasing horsepower in\\na reciprocating engine is by use of a turbosupercharger,\\nor turbocharger, as it is usually called. A drawback of\\ngear-driven superchargers is that they use a large\\namount of the engine’s power output for the amount of\\npower increase they produce. This problem is avoided\\nwith a turbocharger, because turbochargers are\\npowered by an engine’s exhaust gases. This means a\\nturbocharger recovers energy from hot exhaust gases\\nthat would otherwise be lost.\\nAnother advantage of turbochargers is that they can be\\ncontrolled to maintain an engine’s rated sea-level\\nhorsepower from sea level up to the engine’s critical\\naltitude. Critical altitude is the maximum altitude at\\nwhich a turbocharged engine can produce its rated\\nhorsepower. Above the critical altitude, power output\\nbegins to decrease like it does for a normally aspirated\\nengine.\\nTurbochargers increase the pressure of the engine’s\\ninduction air, which allows the engine to develop sea\\nlevel or greater horsepower at higher altitudes. A\\nturbocharger is comprised of two main elements—a\\nturbine and a compressor. The compressor section\\nhouses an impeller that turns at a high rate of speed. As\\ninduction air is drawn across the impeller blades, the\\nimpeller accelerates the air, allowing a large volume of\\nair to be drawn into the compressor housing. The\\nimpeller’s action subsequently produces high-pressure,\\nhigh-density air, which is delivered to the engine. To\\nturn the impeller, the engine’s exhaust gases are used to\\ndrive a turbine wheel that is mounted on the opposite\\nend of the impeller’s drive shaft. By directing different\\namounts of exhaust gases to flow over the turbine,\\nmore energy can be extracted, causing the impeller to\\ndeliver more compressed air to the engine. The waste\\ngate is used to vary the mass of exhaust gas flowing\\ninto the turbine. A waste gate is essentially an\\nadjustable butterfly valve that is installed in the exhaust\\nsystem. When closed, most of the exhaust gases from\\nthe engine are forced to flow through the turbine. When\\nopen, the exhaust gases are allowed to bypass the\\nturbine by flowing directly out through the engine’s\\nexhaust pipe. [Figure 5-12]\\nSince the temperature of a gas rises when it is\\ncompressed, turbocharging causes the temperature of\\nthe induction air to increase. To reduce this\\ntemperature and lower the risk of detonation, many\\nturbocharged engines use an intercooler. An\\nintercooler is a small heat exchanger that uses outside\\nair to cool the hot compressed air before it enters the\\nfuel metering device.\\nSYSTEM OPERATION\\nOn most modern turbocharged engines, the position of\\nthe waste gate is governed by a pressure-sensing\\ncontrol mechanism coupled to an actuator. Engine oil\\ndirected into or away from this actuator moves the\\nwaste gate position. On these systems, the actuator is\\nautomatically positioned to produce the desired MAP\\nsimply by changing the position of the throttle control.\\nOther turbocharging system designs use a separate\\nmanual control to position the waste gate. With manual\\ncontrol, you must closely monitor the manifold\\npressure gauge to determine when the desired MAP has\\nbeen achieved. Manual systems are often found on\\naircraft that have been modified with aftermarket\\nturbocharging systems. These systems require special\\noperating considerations.

To help\\nprevent overboosting, you should advance the throttle\\ncautiously to prevent exceeding the maximum\\nmanifold pressure limits.\\nThere are system limitations that you should be aware\\nof when flying an aircraft with a turbocharger. For\\ninstance, a turbocharger turbine and impeller can\\noperate at rotational speeds in excess of 80,000 r.p.m.\\nwhile at extremely high temperatures. To achieve high\\nrotational speed, the bearings within the system must\\nbe constantly supplied with engine oil to reduce the\\nfrictional forces and high temperature. To obtain\\nadequate lubrication, the oil temperature should be in\\nthe normal operating range before high throttle settings\\nare applied. In addition, you should allow the\\nturbocharger to cool and the turbine to slow down\\nbefore shutting the engine down. Otherwise, the oil\\nremaining in the bearing housing will boil, causing\\nhard carbon deposits to form on the bearings and shaft.\\nThese deposits rapidly deteriorate the turbocharger’s\\nefficiency and service life. For further limitations, refer\\nto the AFM/POH.\\nHIGH ALTITUDE PERFORMANCE\\nAs an aircraft equipped with a turbocharging system\\nclimbs, the waste gate is gradually closed to maintain\\nthe maximum allowable manifold pressure. At some\\npoint, however, the waste gate will be fully closed, and\\nwith further increases in altitude, the manifold pressure\\nwill begin to decrease. This is the critical altitude,\\nwhich is established by the airplane or engine\\nmanufacturer. When evaluating the performance of the\\nturbocharging system, if the manifold pressure begins\\ndecreasing before the specified critical altitude, the\\nengine and turbocharging system should be inspected\\nby a qualified aviation maintenance technician to\\nverify the system’s proper operation.\\nIGNITION SYSTEM\\nThe ignition system provides the spark that ignites the\\nfuel/air mixture in the cylinders and is made up of\\nmagnetos, spark plugs, high-tension leads, and the\\nignition switch.

The magneto generates\\nsufficiently high voltage to jump a spark across the\\nspark plug gap in each cylinder. The system begins to\\nfire when you engage the starter and the crankshaft\\nbegins to turn. It continues to operate whenever the\\ncrankshaft is rotating.\\nMost standard certificated airplanes incorporate a dual\\nignition system with two individual magnetos, separate\\nsets of wires, and spark plugs to increase reliability\\nof the ignition system. Each magneto operates\\nindependently to fire one of the two spark plugs in each\\ncylinder. The firing of two spark plugs improves\\ncombustion of the fuel/air mixture and results in a\\nslightly higher power output. If one of the magnetos\\nfails, the other is unaffected. The engine will continue\\nto operate normally, although you can expect a slight\\ndecrease in engine power. The same is true if one of the\\ntwo spark plugs in a cylinder fails.\\nThe operation of the magneto is controlled in the\\ncockpit by the ignition switch. The switch has\\nfive positions:\\n1. OFF\\n2. R—Right\\n3. L—Left\\n4. BOTH\\n5. START\\nWith RIGHT or LEFT selected, only the associated\\nmagneto is activated. The system operates on both\\nmagnetos with BOTH selected.\\nYou can identify a malfunctioning ignition system\\nduring the pretakeoff check by observing the decrease\\nin r.p.m. that occurs when you first move the ignition\\nswitch from BOTH to RIGHT, and then from BOTH to\\nLEFT. A small decrease in engine r.p.m. is normal\\nduring this check. The permissible decrease is listed in\\nthe AFM or POH. If the engine stops running when you\\nswitch to one magneto or if the r.p.m. drop exceeds the\\nallowable limit, do not fly the airplane until the\\nproblem is corrected. The cause could be fouled plugs,\\nbroken or shorted wires between the magneto and the\\nplugs, or improperly timed firing of the plugs. It should\\nbe noted that “no drop” in r.p.m. is not normal, and in\\nthat instance, the airplane should not be flown.\\nFollowing engine shutdown, turn the ignition switch to\\nthe OFF position. Even with the battery and master\\nswitches OFF, the engine can fire and turn over if you\\nleave the ignition switch ON and the propeller is\\nmoved because the magneto requires no outside source\\nof electrical power. The potential for serious injury in\\nthis situation is obvious.\\nLoose or broken wires in the ignition system also can\\ncause problems. For example, if the ignition switch is\\nOFF, the magneto may continue to fire if the ignition\\nswitch ground wire is disconnected. If this occurs, the\\nonly way to stop the engine is to move the\\nmixture lever to the idle cutoff position, then have the\\nsystem checked by a qualified aviation maintenance\\ntechnician.\\nCOMBUSTION\\nDuring normal combustion, the fuel/air mixture burns\\nin a very controlled and predictable manner. Although\\nthe process occurs in a fraction of a second, the mixture\\nactually begins to burn at the point where it is ignited\\nby the spark plugs, then burns away from the plugs\\nuntil it is all consumed. This type of combustion causes\\na smooth buildup of temperature and pressure and\\nensures that the expanding gases deliver the maximum\\nforce to the piston at exactly the right time in the power\\nstroke. [Figure 5-14]\\nDetonation is an uncontrolled, explosive ignition of\\nthe fuel/air mixture within the cylinder’s combustion\\nchamber. It causes excessive temperatures and\\npressures which, if not corrected, can quickly lead to\\nfailure of the piston, cylinder, or valves. In less severe\\ncases, detonation causes engine overheating,\\nroughness, or loss of power.\\nDetonation is characterized by high cylinder head\\ntemperatures, and is most likely to occur when\\noperating at high power settings. Some common\\noperational causes of detonation include:\\nMagneto—A self-contained, engine-driven unit that supplies electrical\\ncurrent to the spark plugs; completely independent of the airplane’s\\nelectrical system. Normally, there are two magnetos per engine.\\nNormal Combustion Explosion\\nFigure 5-14.

Premature\\nburning is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the\\ncombustion chamber, often created by a small carbon\\ndeposit on a spark plug, a cracked spark plug insulator,\\nor other damage in the cylinder that causes a part to\\nheat sufficiently to ignite the fuel/air charge.\\nPreignition causes the engine to lose power, and\\nproduces high operating temperature. As with\\ndetonation, preignition may also cause severe\\nengine damage, because the expanding gases exert\\nexcessive pressure on the piston while still on its\\ncompression stroke.\\nDetonation and preignition often occur simultaneously\\nand one may cause the other. Since either condition\\ncauses high engine temperature accompanied by a\\ndecrease in engine performance, it is often difficult to\\ndistinguish between the two. Using the recommended\\ngrade of fuel and operating the engine within its proper\\ntemperature, pressure, and r.p.m. ranges reduce the\\nchance of detonation or preignition.\\nFUEL SYSTEMS\\nThe fuel system is designed to provide an uninterrupted\\nflow of clean fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine. The\\nfuel must be available to the engine under all\\nconditions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and\\nduring all approved flight maneuvers. Two common\\nclassifications apply to fuel systems in small\\nairplanes\\uf8e7gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems.\\nThe gravity-feed system utilizes the force of gravity to\\ntransfer the fuel from the tanks to the engine \\uf8e7for\\nexample, on high-wing airplanes where the fuel tanks\\nare installed in the wings. This places the fuel tanks\\nabove the carburetor, and the fuel is gravity fed through\\nthe system and into the carburetor. If the design of the\\nairplane is such that gravity cannot be used to transfer\\nfuel, fuel pumps are installed \\uf8e7for example, on\\nlow-wing airplanes where the fuel tanks in the wings\\nare located below the carburetor.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='5-14\\nFUEL PUMPS\\nAirplanes with fuel pump systems have two fuel\\npumps. The main pump system is engine driven, and an\\nelectrically driven auxiliary pump is provided for use\\nin engine starting and in the event the engine pump\\nfails. The auxiliary pump, also known as a boost pump,\\nprovides added reliability to the fuel system. The\\nelectrically driven auxiliary pump is controlled by a\\nswitch in the cockpit.\\nFUEL PRIMER\\nBoth gravity fed and pump systems may incorporate a\\nfuel primer into the system. The primer is used to draw\\nfuel from the tanks to vaporize it directly into the\\ncylinders prior to starting the engine. This is\\nparticularly helpful during cold weather, when engines\\nare hard to start because there is not enough heat\\navailable to vaporize the fuel in the carburetor. It is\\nimportant to lock the primer in place when it is not in\\nuse. If the knob is free to move, it may vibrate out\\nduring flight and can cause an excessively rich\\nmixture. To avoid overpriming, read the priming\\ninstructions for your airplane.\\nFUEL TANKS\\nThe fuel tanks, normally located inside the wings of an\\nairplane, have a filler opening on top of the wing\\nthrough which they can be filled. A filler cap covers\\nthis opening. The tanks are vented to the outside to\\nmaintain atmospheric pressure inside the tank. They\\nmay be vented through the filler cap or through a tube\\nextending through the surface of the wing. Fuel tanks\\nalso include an overflow drain that may stand alone or\\nbe collocated with the fuel tank vent. This allows fuel\\nto expand with increases in temperature without\\ndamage to the tank itself. If the tanks have been filled\\non a hot day, it is not unusual to see fuel coming from\\nthe overflow drain.\\nFUEL GAUGES\\nThe fuel quantity gauges indicate the amount of fuel\\nmeasured by a sensing unit in each fuel tank and is\\ndisplayed in gallons or pounds. Aircraft certification\\nrules only require accuracy in fuel gauges when they\\nread “empty.” Any reading other than “empty” should\\nbe verified. Do not depend solely on the accuracy of\\nthe fuel quantity gauges. Always visually check the\\nfuel level in each tank during the preflight inspection,\\nand then compare it with the corresponding fuel\\nquantity indication.\\nIf a fuel pump is installed in the fuel system, a fuel\\npressure gauge is also included. This gauge indicates\\nthe pressure in the fuel lines. The normal operating\\npressure can be found in the AFM/POH, or on the\\ngauge by color coding.\\nFUEL SELECTORS\\nThe fuel selector valve allows selection of fuel from\\nvarious tanks. A common type of selector valve\\ncontains four positions: LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH, and\\nOFF. Selecting the LEFT or RIGHT position allows\\nfuel to feed only from that tank, while selecting the\\nBOTH position feeds fuel from both tanks. The LEFT\\nor RIGHT position may be used to balance the amount\\nof fuel remaining in each wing tank. [Figure 5-16]\\nFuel placards will show any limitations on fuel tank\\nusage, such as “level flight only” and/or “both” for\\nlandings and takeoffs.\\nRegardless of the type of fuel selector in use, fuel\\nconsumption should be monitored closely to ensure\\nthat a tank does not run completely out of fuel. Running\\na fuel tank dry will not only cause the engine to stop,\\nbut running for prolonged periods on one tank causes\\nan unbalanced fuel load between tanks. Running a tank\\ncompletely dry may allow air to enter the fuel system,\\nwhich may cause vapor lock. When this situation\\ndevelops, it may be difficult to restart the engine. On\\nfuel-injected engines, the fuel may become so hot it\\nvaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing fuel to reach\\nthe cylinders.\\nFUEL STRAINERS, SUMPS, AND DRAINS\\nAfter the fuel selector valve, the fuel passes through a\\nstrainer before it enters the carburetor. This strainer\\nremoves moisture and other sediments that might be in\\nthe system. Since these contaminants are heavier than\\naviation fuel, they settle in a sump at the bottom of the\\nstrainer assembly. A sump is defined as a low point in a\\nfuel system and/or fuel tank. The fuel system may\\ncontain sump, fuel strainer, and fuel tank drains, some\\nof which may be collocated.\\nThe fuel strainer should be drained before each flight.\\nFuel samples should be drained and checked visually\\nFigure 5-16.

Water in the sump is\\nhazardous because in cold weather the water can freeze\\nand block fuel lines. In warm weather, it can flow into\\nthe carburetor and stop the engine. If water is present in\\nthe sump, it is likely there is more water in the fuel\\ntanks, and you should continue to drain them until there\\nis no evidence of water. In any event, never take off\\nuntil you are certain that all water and contaminants\\nhave been removed from the engine fuel system.\\nBecause of the variation in fuel systems, you should\\nbecome thoroughly familiar with the systems that apply\\nto your airplane. Consult the AFM or POH for specific\\noperating procedures.\\nFUEL GRADES\\nAviation gasoline, or AVGAS, is identified by an\\noctane or performance number (grade), which\\ndesignates the antiknock value or knock resistance of\\nthe fuel mixture in the engine cylinder. The higher the\\ngrade of gasoline, the more pressure the fuel can\\nwithstand without detonating. Lower grades of fuel are\\nused in lower-compression engines because these fuels\\nignite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used in\\nhigher-compression engines, because they must ignite\\nat higher temperatures, but not prematurely. If the\\nproper grade of fuel is not available, use the next higher\\ngrade as a substitute. Never use a lower grade. This can\\ncause the cylinder head temperature and engine oil\\ntemperature to exceed their normal operating range,\\nwhich may result in detonation.\\nSeveral grades of aviation fuel are available. Care must\\nbe exercised to ensure that the correct aviation grade is\\nbeing used for the specific type of engine. The proper\\nfuel grade is stated in the AFM or POH, on placards in\\nthe cockpit, and next to the filler caps. Due to its lead\\ncontent, auto gas should NEVER be used in aircraft\\nengines unless the aircraft has been modified with a\\nSupplemental Type Certificate (STC) issued by the\\nFederal Aviation Administration.\\nThe current method to identify aviation gasoline for\\naircraft with reciprocating engines is by the octane and\\nperformance number, along with the abbreviation\\nAVGAS. These aircraft use AVGAS 80, 100, and\\n100LL. Although A VGAS 100LL performs the same as\\ngrade 100, the “LL” indicates it has a low lead content.\\nFuel for aircraft with turbine engines is classified as\\nJET A, JET A-1, and JET B. Jet fuel is basically\\nkerosene and has a distinctive kerosene smell.\\nSince use of the correct fuel is critical, dyes are\\nadded to help identify the type and grade of fuel.\\n[Figure 5-17]\\nIn addition to the color of the fuel itself, the\\ncolor-coding system extends to decals and various\\nairport fuel handling equipment. For example, all\\naviation gasolines are identified by name, using white\\nletters on a red background. In contrast, turbine fuels\\nare identified by white letters on a black background.\\nFUEL CONTAMINATION\\nOf the accidents attributed to powerplant failure from\\nfuel contamination, most have been traced to:\\n• Inadequate preflight inspection by the pilot.\\n• Servicing aircraft with improperly filtered fuel\\nfrom small tanks or drums.\\n• Storing aircraft with partially filled fuel tanks.\\n• Lack of proper maintenance.\\nFuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick\\ndrain and from each fuel tank sump into a transparent\\ncontainer, and then checked for dirt and water. When\\nthe fuel strainer is being drained, water in the tank may\\nnot appear until all the fuel has been drained from the\\nlines leading to the tank. This indicates that water\\nremains in the tank, and is not forcing the fuel out of\\nthe fuel lines leading to the fuel strainer. Therefore,\\ndrain enough fuel from the fuel strainer to be certain\\nthat fuel is being drained from the tank. The amount\\nwill depend on the length of fuel line from the tank to\\nthe drain. If water or other contaminants are found in\\nthe first sample, drain further samples until no\\ntrace appears.\\n80\\nAVGAS\\n100\\nAVGAS\\nRED\\nGREEN\\nAVGAS 80\\nAVGAS 100\\n100LL\\nAVGAS\\nBLUEAVGAS 100LL\\nJET\\nA\\nCOLORLESS\\nOR STRAW\\nJET A\\nFUEL TYPE\\nAND GRADE\\nCOLOR OF\\nFUEL\\nEQUIPMENT\\nCOLOR\\nFigure 5-17.

This residual water can be removed only\\nby draining the fuel tank sump drains.\\nWater is the principal fuel contaminant. Suspended\\nwater droplets in the fuel can be identified by a cloudy\\nappearance of the fuel or by the clear separation of\\nwater from the colored fuel, which occurs after the\\nwater has settled to the bottom of the tank. As a safety\\nmeasure, the fuel sumps should be drained before every\\nflight during the preflight inspection.\\nFuel tanks should be filled after each flight, or at least\\nafter the last flight of the day to prevent moisture\\ncondensation within the tank. Another way to prevent\\nfuel contamination is to avoid refueling from cans and\\ndrums. Refueling from cans or drums may result in fuel\\ncontamination.\\nThe use of a funnel and chamois skin when refueling\\nfrom cans or drums is hazardous under any conditions,\\nand should be discouraged. In remote areas or in\\nemergency situations, there may be no alternative to\\nrefueling from sources with inadequate anticontamina-\\ntion systems, and a chamois and funnel may be the only\\npossible means of filtering fuel. However, the use of a\\nchamois will not always ensure decontaminated fuel.\\nWorn-out chamois will not filter water; neither will a\\nnew, clean chamois that is already water-wet or damp.\\nMost imitation chamois skins will not filter water.\\nREFUELING PROCEDURES\\nStatic electricity is formed by the friction of air passing\\nover the surfaces of an airplane in flight and by the flow\\nof fuel through the hose and nozzle during refueling.\\nNylon, dacron, or wool clothing is especially prone to\\naccumulate and discharge static electricity from the\\nperson to the funnel or nozzle. To guard against the\\npossibility of static electricity igniting fuel fumes, a\\nground wire should be attached to the aircraft before\\nthe fuel cap is removed from the tank. The refueling\\nnozzle then should be grounded to the aircraft before\\nrefueling is begun, and should remain grounded\\nthroughout the refueling process. When a fuel truck is\\nused, it should be grounded prior to the fuel nozzle\\ncontacting the aircraft.\\nIf fueling from drums or cans is necessary, proper\\nbonding and grounding connections are important.\\nDrums should be placed near grounding posts, and the\\nfollowing sequence of connections observed:\\n1. Drum to ground.\\n2. Ground to aircraft.\\n3. Drum to aircraft.\\n4. Nozzle to aircraft before the fuel cap is removed.\\nWhen disconnecting, reverse the order.\\nThe passage of fuel through a chamois increases the\\ncharge of static electricity and the danger of sparks. The\\naircraft must be properly grounded and the nozzle,\\nchamois filter, and funnel bonded to the aircraft. If a\\ncan is used, it should be connected to either the\\ngrounding post or the funnel. Under no circumstances\\nshould a plastic bucket or similar nonconductive\\ncontainer be used in this operation.\\nSTARTING SYSTEM\\nMost small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter\\nsystem. This system consists of a source of electricity,\\nwiring, switches, and solenoids to operate the starter\\nand a starter motor. Most aircraft have starters that\\nautomatically engage and disengage when operated,\\nbut some older aircraft have starters that are\\nmechanically engaged by a lever actuated by the pilot.\\nThe starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating the\\nengine at a speed that allows the engine to start and\\nmaintain operation.\\nElectrical power for starting is usually supplied by an\\non-board battery, but can also be supplied by external\\npower through an external power receptacle. When the\\nbattery switch is turned on, electricity is supplied to the\\nmain power bus through the battery solenoid. Both the\\nstarter and the starter switch draw current from the main\\nbus, but the starter will not operate until the starting\\nsolenoid is energized by the starter switch being turned\\nto the “start” position. When the starter switch is released\\nfrom the “start” position, the solenoid removes power\\nfrom the starter motor. The starter motor is protected\\nfrom being driven by the engine through a clutch in the\\nstarter drive that allows the engine to run faster than the\\nstarter motor. [Figure 5-18]\\nWhen starting an engine, the rules of safety and\\ncourtesy should be strictly observed. One of the most\\nimportant is to make sure there is no one near the\\npropeller. In addition, the wheels should be chocked\\nand the brakes set, to avoid hazards caused by\\nunintentional movement. To avoid damage to the\\npropeller and property, the airplane should be in an area\\nwhere the propeller will not stir up gravel or dust.\\nOIL SYSTEMS\\nThe engine oil system performs several important\\nfunctions, including:\\n• Lubrication of the engine’s moving parts.\\n• Cooling of the engine by reducing friction.\\n• Removing heat from the cylinders.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-16'),\n",

In a dry-sump system, the oil is\\ncontained in a separate tank, and circulated through the\\nengine by pumps. In a wet-sump system, the oil is\\nlocated in a sump, which is an integral part of the\\nengine. [Figure 5-19]\\nThe main component of a wet-sump system is the oil\\npump, which draws oil from the sump and routes it to\\nthe engine. After the oil passes through the engine, it\\nreturns to the sump. In some engines, additional\\nlubrication is supplied by the rotating crankshaft,\\nwhich splashes oil onto portions of the engine.\\nAn oil pump also supplies oil pressure in a dry-sump\\nsystem, but the source of the oil is a separate oil tank,\\nlocated external to the engine. After oil is routed\\nthrough the engine, it is pumped from the various\\nlocations in the engine back to the oil tank by scavenge\\npumps. Dry sump systems allow for a greater volume\\nof oil to be supplied to the engine, which makes them\\nmore suitable for very large reciprocating engines.\\nThe oil pressure gauge provides a direct indication of\\nthe oil system operation.

Low\\ntemperature indications may indicate improper oil\\nviscosity during cold weather operations.\\nThe oil filler cap and dipstick (for measuring the oil\\nquantity) are usually accessible through a panel in the\\nengine cowling. If the quantity does not meet the\\nmanufacturer’s recommended operating levels, oil\\nshould be added. The AFM, POH, or placards near the\\naccess panel provide information about the correct oil\\ntype and weight, as well as the minimum and maximum\\noil quantity. [Figure 5-20]\\nENGINE COOLING SYSTEMS\\nThe burning fuel within the cylinders produces intense\\nheat, most of which is expelled through the exhaust\\nsystem. Much of the remaining heat, however, must be\\nremoved, or at least dissipated, to prevent the engine\\nfrom overheating. Otherwise, the extremely high\\nengine temperatures can lead to loss of power,\\nexcessive oil consumption, detonation, and serious\\nengine damage.\\nWhile the oil system is vital to internal cooling of the\\nengine, an additional method of cooling is necessary\\nfor the engine’s external surface. Most small airplanes\\nare air cooled, although some are liquid cooled.\\nAir cooling is accomplished by air flowing into the\\nengine compartment through openings in front of the\\nengine cowling. Baffles route this air over fins attached\\nto the engine cylinders, and other parts of the engine,\\nwhere the air absorbs the engine heat. Expulsion of the\\nhot air takes place through one or more openings in the\\nlower, aft portion of the engine cowling.

It will also lead to\\nserious permanent damage, such as scoring the\\ncylinder walls, damaging the pistons and rings, and\\nburning and warping the valves. Monitoring the\\ncockpit engine temperature instruments will aid in\\navoiding high operating temperature.\\nUnder normal operating conditions in airplanes not\\nequipped with cowl flaps, the engine temperature can\\nbe controlled by changing the airspeed or the power\\noutput of the engine. High engine temperatures can be\\ndecreased by increasing the airspeed and/or reducing\\nthe power.\\nThe oil temperature gauge gives an indirect and\\ndelayed indication of rising engine temperature, but\\ncan be used for determining engine temperature if this\\nis the only means available.\\nMany airplanes are equipped with a cylinder-head\\ntemperature gauge. This instrument indicates a direct\\nand immediate cylinder temperature change. This\\ninstrument is calibrated in degrees Celsius or\\nFahrenheit, and is usually color-coded with a green arc\\nto indicate the normal operating range. A red line on\\nthe instrument indicates maximum allowable cylinder\\nhead temperature.\\nTo avoid excessive cylinder head temperatures,\\nincrease airspeed, enrich the mixture, and/or reduce\\npower. Any of these procedures help in reducing the\\nengine temperature. On airplanes equipped with\\ncowl flaps , use the cowl flap positions to control the\\ntemperature. Cowl flaps are hinged covers that fit over\\nthe opening through which the hot air is expelled. If the\\nengine temperature is low, the cowl flaps can be closed,\\nthereby restricting the flow of expelled hot air and\\nincreasing engine temperature. If the engine\\ntemperature is high, the cowl flaps can be opened to\\npermit a greater flow of air through the system, thereby\\ndecreasing the engine temperature.\\nEXHAUST SYSTEMS\\nEngine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion\\ngases overboard, provide heat for the cabin, and defrost\\nthe windscreen. An exhaust system has exhaust piping\\nattached to the cylinders, as well as a muffler and a\\nmuffler shroud. The exhaust gases are pushed out of\\nthe cylinder through the exhaust valve and then through\\nthe exhaust pipe system to the atmosphere.\\nFor cabin heat, outside air is drawn into the air inlet\\nand is ducted through a shroud around the muffler. The\\nmuffler is heated by the exiting exhaust gases and, in\\nturn, heats the air around the muffler. This heated air is\\nthen ducted to the cabin for heat and defrost\\napplications. The heat and defrost are controlled in the\\ncockpit, and can be adjusted to the desired level.\\nExhaust gases contain large amounts of carbon\\nmonoxide, which is odorless and colorless. Carbon\\nmonoxide is deadly, and its presence is virtually\\nimpossible to detect. The exhaust system must be in\\ngood condition and free of cracks.\\nSome exhaust systems have an exhaust gas\\ntemperature probe. This probe transmits the exhaust\\ngas temperature (EGT) to an instrument in the cockpit.\\nThe EGT gauge measures the temperature of the gases\\nat the exhaust manifold. This temperature varies with\\nthe ratio of fuel to air entering the cylinders and can be\\nused as a basis for regulating the fuel/air mixture. The\\nEGT gauge is highly accurate in indicating the correct\\nmixture setting. When using the EGT to aid in leaning\\nthe fuel/air mixture, fuel consumption can be reduced.\\nFor specific procedures, refer to the manufacturer’s\\nrecommendations for leaning the mixture.\\nELECTRICAL SYSTEM\\nAirplanes are equipped with either a 14- or 28-volt\\ndirect-current electrical system. A basic airplane\\nelectrical system consists of the following components:\\n• Alternator/generator\\n• Battery\\n• Master/battery switch\\n• Alternator/generator switch\\n• Bus bar, fuses, and circuit breakers\\n• V oltage regulator\\n• Ammeter/loadmeter\\n• Associated electrical wiring\\nEngine-driven alternators or generators supply electric\\ncurrent to the electrical system. They also maintain a\\nsufficient electrical charge in the battery.

In addition, an\\nalternator switch is installed which permits the pilot to\\nexclude the alternator from the electrical system in the\\nevent of alternator failure. [Figure 5-22]\\nWith the alternator half of the switch in the OFF\\nposition, the entire electrical load is placed on the\\nbattery. Therefore, all nonessential electrical equipment\\nshould be turned off to conserve  battery power.\\nA bus bar is used as a terminal in the airplane electrical\\nsystem to connect the main electrical system to the\\nequipment using electricity as a source of power. This\\nsimplifies the wiring system and provides a common\\npoint from which voltage can be distributed throughout\\nthe system. [Figure 5-23]\\nFuses or circuit breakers are used in the electrical system\\nto protect the circuits and equipment from electrical\\noverload.

When all electrical com-\\nponents are turned off, it reflects only the amount of\\ncharging current demanded by the battery.\\nA voltage regulator controls the rate of charge to the\\nbattery by stabilizing the generator or alternator\\nelectrical output. The generator/alternator voltage\\noutput should be higher than the battery voltage. For\\nexample, a 12-volt battery would be fed by a\\ngenerator/alternator system of approximately 14 volts.\\nThe difference in voltage keeps the battery charged.\\nHYDRAULIC SYSTEMS\\nThere are multiple applications for hydraulic use in\\nairplanes, depending on the complexity of the airplane.\\nFor example, hydraulics are often used on small\\nairplanes to operate wheel brakes, retractable landing\\ngear, and some constant-speed propellers. On large\\nairplanes, hydraulics are used for flight control\\nsurfaces, wing flaps, spoilers, and other systems.\\nA basic hydraulic system consists of a reservoir, pump\\n(either hand, electric, or engine driven), a filter to keep\\nthe fluid clean, selector valve to control the direction of\\nflow, relief valve to relieve excess pressure, and an\\nactuator.\\nThe hydraulic fluid is pumped through the system to an\\nactuator or servo. Servos can be either single-acting or\\ndouble-acting servos based on the needs of the system.\\nThis means that the fluid can be applied to one or both\\nsides of the servo, depending on the servo type, and\\ntherefore provides power in one direction with a\\nsingle-acting servo. A servo is a cylinder with a piston\\ninside that turns fluid power into work and creates the\\npower needed to move an aircraft system or flight\\ncontrol. The selector valve allows the fluid direction to\\nbe controlled. This is necessary for operations like the\\nextension and retraction of landing gear where the fluid\\nmust work in two different directions. The relief valve\\nprovides an outlet for the system in the event of\\nexcessive fluid pressure in the system. Each system\\nincorporates different components to meet the\\nindividual needs of different aircraft.\\nA mineral-based fluid is the most widely used type for\\nsmall airplanes. This type of hydraulic fluid, which is a\\nkerosene-like petroleum product, has good lubricating\\nproperties, as well as additives to inhibit foaming and\\nprevent the formation of corrosion. It is quite stable\\nchemically, has very little viscosity change with\\ntemperature, and is dyed for identification. Since\\nseveral types of hydraulic fluids are commonly used,\\nmake sure your airplane is serviced with the type\\nspecified by the manufacturer. Refer to the AFM, POH,\\nor the Maintenance Manual. [Figure 5-25]\\nLANDING GEAR\\nThe landing gear forms the principal support of the\\nairplane on the surface. The most common type of\\nlanding gear consists of wheels, but airplanes can also\\nbe equipped with floats for water operations, or skis for\\nlanding on snow. [Figure 5-26]\\nThe landing gear on small airplanes consists of three\\nwheels\\uf8e7two main wheels, one located on each side of\\nthe fuselage, and a third wheel, positioned either at the\\nfront or rear of the airplane. Landing gear employing a\\nrear-mounted wheel is called a conventional landing\\ngear. Airplanes with conventional landing gear are\\noften referred to as tailwheel airplanes. When the third\\nwheel is located on the nose, it is called a nosewheel,\\nand the design is referred to as a tricycle gear. A\\nsteerable nosewheel or tailwheel permits the airplane\\nto be controlled throughout all operations while on\\nthe ground.\\nTRICYCLE LANDING GEAR AIRPLANES\\nA tricycle gear airplane has three main advantages:\\nServo—A motor or other form of actuator which receives a small signal\\nfrom the control device and exerts a large force to accomplish the\\ndesired work.\\nReservoir Double-\\nActing\\nCylinder\\nMotion\\nSelector Valve\\nC.V.

It allows more forceful application of the brakes\\nduring landings at high speeds without resulting\\nin the airplane nosing over.\\n2. It permits better forward visibility for the pilot\\nduring takeoff, landing, and taxiing.\\n3. It tends to prevent ground looping (swerving) by\\nproviding more directional stability during\\nground operation since the airplane’s center of\\ngravity (CG) is forward of the main wheels. The\\nforward CG, therefore, tends to keep the airplane\\nmoving forward in a straight line rather than\\nground looping.\\nNosewheels are either steerable or castering. Steerable\\nnosewheels are linked to the rudders by cables or rods,\\nwhile castering nosewheels are free to swivel. In both\\ncases, you steer the airplane using the rudder pedals.\\nHowever, airplanes with a castering nosewheel may\\nrequire you to combine the use of the rudder pedals\\nwith independent use of the brakes.\\nTAILWHEEL LANDING GEAR AIRPLANES\\nOn tailwheel airplanes, two main wheels, which are\\nattached to the airframe ahead of its center of gravity,\\nsupport most of the weight of the structure, while a\\ntailwheel at the very back of the fuselage provides a\\nthird point of support. This arrangement allows\\nadequate ground clearance for a larger propeller and is\\nmore desirable for operations on unimproved fields.\\n[Figure 5-27]\\nThe main drawback with the tailwheel landing gear is\\nthat the center of gravity is behind the main gear. This\\nmakes directional control more difficult while on the\\nground. If you allow the airplane to swerve while\\nrolling on the ground at a speed below that at which the\\nrudder has sufficient control, the center of gravity will\\nattempt to get ahead of the main gear. This may cause\\nthe airplane to ground loop.\\nAnother disadvantage for tailwheel airplanes is the lack\\nof good forward visibility when the tailwheel is on or\\nnear the surface. Because of the associated hazards,\\nspecific training is required in tailwheel airplanes.\\nFIXED AND RETRACTABLE LANDING GEAR\\nLanding gear can also be classified as either fixed or\\nretractable. A fixed gear always remains extended and\\nhas the advantage of simplicity combined with low\\nmaintenance. A retractable gear is designed to\\nstreamline the airplane by allowing the landing gear to\\nbe stowed inside the structure during cruising flight.\\n[Figure 5-28]\\nBRAKES\\nAirplane brakes are located on the main wheels and are\\napplied by either a hand control or by foot pedals (toe\\nor heel). Foot pedals operate independently and allow\\nfor differential braking. During ground operations,\\ndifferential braking can supplement nosewheel/tail-\\nwheel steering.\\nAUTOPILOT\\nAutopilots are designed to control the aircraft and help\\nreduce the pilot’s workload. The limitations of the\\nautopilot depend on the complexity of the system. The\\nFigure 5-27. Tailwheel landing gear.\\nFigure 5-28.

More advanced systems may include\\na vertical speed and/or indicated airspeed hold\\nmode. Most autopilot systems are coupled to\\nnavigational aids.\\nAn autopilot system consists of servos that actuate the\\nflight controls. The number and location of these\\nservos depends on the complexity of the system. For\\nexample, a single-axis autopilot controls the aircraft\\nabout the longitudinal axis and a servo actuates the\\nailerons. A three-axis autopilot controls the aircraft\\nabout the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical axes; and\\nthree different servos actuate the ailerons, the elevator,\\nand the rudder.\\nThe autopilot system also incorporates a disconnect\\nsafety feature to automatically or manually disengage\\nthe system. Autopilots can also be manually\\noverridden. Because autopilot systems differ widely in\\ntheir operation, refer to the autopilot operating\\ninstructions in the AFM or POH.\\nPRESSURIZED AIRPLANES\\nWhen an airplane is flown at a high altitude, it\\nconsumes less fuel for a given airspeed than it does for\\nthe same speed at a lower altitude. In other words, the\\nairplane is more efficient at a high altitude. In addition,\\nbad weather and turbulence may be avoided by flying\\nin the relatively smooth air above the storms. Because\\nof the advantages of flying at high altitudes,\\nmany modern general aviation-type airplanes are\\nbeing designed to operate in that environment. It is\\nimportant that pilots transitioning to such sophisticated\\nequipment be familiar with at least the basic\\noperating principles.\\nA cabin pressurization system accomplishes several\\nfunctions in providing adequate passenger comfort and\\nsafety. It maintains a cabin pressure altitude of\\napproximately 8,000 feet at the maximum designed\\ncruising altitude of the airplane, and prevents rapid\\nchanges of cabin altitude that may be uncomfortable or\\ncause injury to passengers and crew. In addition, the\\npressurization system permits a reasonably fast\\nexchange of air from the inside to the outside of the\\ncabin. This is necessary to eliminate odors and to\\nremove stale air. [Figure 5-29]\\nPressurization of the airplane cabin is an accepted\\nmethod of protecting occupants against the effects of\\nhypoxia. Within a pressurized cabin, occupants can be\\ntransported comfortably and safely for long periods of\\ntime, particularly if the cabin altitude is maintained at\\n8,000 feet or below, where the use of oxygen\\nequipment is not required. The flight crew in this type\\nof airplane must be aware of the danger of accidental\\nloss of cabin pressure and must be prepared to deal with\\nsuch an emergency whenever it occurs.\\nIn the typical pressurization system, the cabin, flight\\ncompartment, and baggage compartments are\\nincorporated into a sealed unit that is capable of\\ncontaining air under a pressure higher than outside\\natmospheric pressure. On aircraft powered by turbine\\nengines, bleed air from the engine compressor section is\\nused to pressurize the cabin. Superchargers may be used\\non older model turbine powered airplanes to pump air\\ninto the sealed fuselage. Piston-powered airplanes may\\nuse air supplied from each engine turbocharger through\\na sonic venturi (flow limiter). Air is released from the\\nfuselage by a device called an outflow valve. The\\noutflow valve, by regulating the air exit, provides a\\nconstant inflow of air to the pressurized area.\\n[Figure 5-30]\\nTo understand the operating principles of\\npressurization and air-conditioning systems, it is\\nnecessary to become familiar with some of the related\\nterms and definitions, such as:\\n• Aircraft altitude —the actual height above sea\\nlevel at which the airplane is flying.\\n• Ambient temperature —the temperature in the\\narea immediately surrounding the airplane.\\nAltitude (ft) Pressure (p.s.i.)

In aircraft air-conditioning and pressurizing\\nsystems, it is the difference between cabin\\npressure and atmospheric pressure.\\nThe cabin pressure control system provides cabin\\npressure regulation, pressure relief, vacuum relief, and\\nthe means for selecting the desired cabin altitude in the\\nisobaric and differential range. In addition, dumping of\\nthe cabin pressure is a function of the pressure control\\nsystem. A cabin pressure regulator, an outflow valve,\\nand a safety valve are used to accomplish these\\nfunctions.\\nThe cabin pressure regulator controls cabin pressure to\\na selected value in the isobaric range and limits cabin\\npressure to a preset differential value in the differential\\nrange. When the airplane reaches the altitude at which\\nthe difference between the pressure inside and outside\\nthe cabin is equal to the highest differential pressure for\\nwhich the fuselage structure is designed, a further\\nincrease in airplane altitude will result in a\\ncorresponding increase in cabin altitude. Differential\\ncontrol is used to prevent the maximum differential\\npressure, for which the fuselage was designed, from\\nbeing exceeded. This differential pressure is\\ndetermined by the structural strength of the cabin and\\noften by the relationship of the cabin size to the\\nprobable areas of rupture, such as window areas\\nand doors.\\nThe cabin air pressure safety valve is a combination\\npressure relief, vacuum relief, and dump valve. The\\npressure relief valve prevents cabin pressure from\\nexceeding a predetermined differential pressure above\\nambient pressure. The vacuum relief prevents ambient\\npressure from exceeding cabin pressure by allowing\\nexternal air to enter the cabin when ambient pressure\\nexceeds cabin pressure. The cockpit control switch\\nactuates the dump valve. When this switch is\\npositioned to ram, a solenoid valve opens, causing the\\nvalve to dump cabin air to atmosphere.\\nThe degree of pressurization and the operating altitude\\nof the aircraft are limited by several critical design\\nfactors. Primarily the fuselage is designed to withstand\\na particular maximum cabin differential pressure.\\nSeveral instruments are used in conjunction with the\\npressurization controller. The cabin differential\\npressure gauge indicates the difference between inside\\nand outside pressure. This gauge should be monitored\\nto assure that the cabin does not exceed the maximum\\nallowable differential pressure. A cabin altimeter is also\\nprovided as a check on the performance of the system.\\nIn some cases, these two instruments are combined into\\none. A third instrument indicates the cabin rate of climb\\nor descent. A cabin rate-of-climb instrument and a\\ncabin altimeter are illustrated in Figure 5-31 on\\npage 5-26.\\nDecompression is defined as the inability of the\\nairplane’s pressurization system to maintain its designed\\npressure differential. This can be caused by a\\nmalfunction in the pressurization system or structural\\ndamage to the airplane. Physiologically, decompressions\\nfall into two categories; they are:\\n• Explosive Decompression —Explosive decom-\\npression is defined as a change in cabin pressure\\nfaster than the lungs can decompress; therefore, it\\nis possible that lung damage may occur.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='5-26\\n• Rapid Decompression—Rapid decompression is\\ndefined as a change in cabin pressure where the\\nlungs can decompress faster than the cabin; there-\\nfore, there is no likelihood of lung damage.\\nDuring an explosive decompression, there may be\\nnoise, and for a split second, one may feel dazed. The\\ncabin air will fill with fog, dust, or flying debris. Fog\\noccurs due to the rapid drop in temperature and the\\nchange of relative humidity. Normally, the ears clear\\nautomatically. Air will rush from the mouth and nose\\ndue to the escape of air from the lungs, and may be\\nnoticed by some individuals.\\nThe primary danger of decompression is hypoxia.\\nUnless proper utilization of oxygen equipment is\\naccomplished quickly, unconsciousness may occur in a\\nvery short time. The period of useful consciousness is\\nconsiderably shortened when a person is subjected to a\\nrapid decompression. This is due to the rapid reduction\\nof pressure on the body—oxygen in the lungs is\\nexhaled rapidly. This in effect reduces the partial\\npressure of oxygen in the blood and therefore reduces\\nthe pilot’s effective performance time by one-third to\\none-fourth its normal time. For this reason, the oxygen\\nmask should be worn when flying at very high altitudes\\n(35,000 feet or higher). It is recommended that the\\ncrewmembers select the 100 percent oxygen setting on\\nthe oxygen regulator at high altitude if the airplane is\\nequipped with a demand or pressure demand oxygen\\nsystem.\\nAnother hazard is being tossed or blown out of the\\nairplane if near an opening. For this reason, individuals\\nnear openings should wear safety harnesses or seatbelts\\nat all times when the airplane is pressurized and they\\nare seated.\\nAnother potential hazard during high altitude\\ndecompressions is the possibility of evolved gas\\ndecompression sicknesses. Exposure to wind blasts and\\nextremely cold temperatures are other hazards one\\nmight have to face.\\nRapid descent from altitude is necessary if these\\nproblems are to be minimized. Automatic visual and\\naural warning systems are included in the equipment of\\nall pressurized airplanes.\\nOXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nMost high altitude airplanes come equipped with some\\ntype of fixed oxygen installation. If the airplane does\\nnot have a fixed installation, portable oxygen\\nequipment must be readily accessible during flight. The\\nportable equipment usually consists of a container,\\nregulator, mask outlet, and pressure gauge. Aircraft\\noxygen is usually stored in high pressure system\\ncontainers of 1,800 – 2,200 pounds per square inch\\n(p.s.i.). When the ambient temperature surrounding an\\noxygen cylinder decreases, pressure within that\\ncylinder will decrease because pressure varies directly\\nwith temperature if the volume of a gas remains\\nconstant. If a drop in indicated pressure on a\\nsupplemental oxygen cylinder is noted, there is no\\nreason to suspect depletion of the oxygen supply, which\\nhas simply been compacted due to storage of the\\ncontainers in an unheated area of the aircraft. High\\npressure oxygen containers should be marked with the\\np.s.i. tolerance (i.e., 1,800 p.s.i.) before filling the\\ncontainer to that pressure. The containers should be\\nsupplied with aviation oxygen only, which is 100\\npercent pure oxygen.

Materials that are nearly fireproof in ordinary\\nair may be susceptible to burning in oxygen. Oils and\\ngreases may catch fire if exposed to oxygen, and\\ncannot be used for sealing the valves and fittings of\\noxygen equipment. Smoking during any kind of\\noxygen equipment use is prohibited. Before each flight,\\nthe pilot should thoroughly inspect and test all oxygen\\nequipment. The inspection should include a thorough\\nexamination of the aircraft oxygen equipment,\\nincluding available supply, an operational check of the\\nsystem, and assurance that the supplemental oxygen is\\nreadily accessible. The inspection should be\\naccomplished with clean hands and should include a\\nvisual inspection of the mask and tubing for tears,\\ncracks, or deterioration; the regulator for valve and\\nlever condition and positions; oxygen quantity; and the\\nlocation and functioning of oxygen pressure gauges,\\nflow indicators and connections. The mask should be\\ndonned and the system should be tested. After any\\noxygen use, verify that all components and valves are\\nshut off.\\nMASKS\\nThere are numerous types of oxygen masks in use that\\nvary in design detail. It would be impractical to discuss\\nall of the types in this handbook. It is important that the\\nmasks used be compatible with the particular oxygen\\nsystem involved. Crew masks are fitted to the user’s\\nface with a minimum of leakage. Crew masks usually\\ncontain a microphone. Most masks are the oronasal-\\ntype, which covers only the mouth and nose.\\nPassenger masks may be simple, cup-shaped rubber\\nmoldings sufficiently flexible to obviate individual\\nfitting. They may have a simple elastic head strap or\\nthe passenger may hold them to the face.\\nAll oxygen masks should be kept clean. This reduces\\nthe danger of infection and prolongs the life of the\\nmask. To clean the mask, wash it with a mild soap and\\nwater solution and rinse it with clear water. If a\\nmicrophone is installed, use a clean swab, instead of\\nrunning water, to wipe off the soapy solution. The mask\\nshould also be disinfected. A gauze pad that has been\\nsoaked in a water solution of Merthiolate can be used\\nto swab out the mask. This solution should contain\\none-fifth teaspoon of Merthiolate per quart of water.\\nWipe the mask with a clean cloth and air dry.\\nDILUTER DEMAND OXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nDiluter demand oxygen systems supply oxygen only\\nwhen the user inhales through the mask. An automix\\nlever allows the regulators to automatically mix cabin\\nair and oxygen or supply 100 percent oxygen,\\ndepending on the altitude. The demand mask provides\\na tight seal over the face to prevent dilution with\\noutside air and can be used safely up to 40,000 feet. A\\npilot who has a beard or mustache should be sure it is\\ntrimmed in a manner that will not interfere with the\\nsealing of the oxygen mask. The fit of the mask around\\nthe beard or mustache should be checked on the ground\\nfor proper sealing.\\nPRESSURE DEMAND OXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nPressure demand oxygen systems are similar to diluter\\ndemand oxygen equipment, except that oxygen is\\nsupplied to the mask under pressure at cabin altitudes\\nabove 34,000 feet. Pressure demand regulators also\\ncreate airtight and oxygen-tight seals, but they also\\nprovide a positive pressure application of oxygen to the\\nmask face piece that allows the user’s lungs to be\\npressurized with oxygen. This feature makes pressure\\ndemand regulators safe at altitudes above 40,000 feet.\\nSome systems may have a pressure demand mask with\\nthe regulator attached directly to the mask, rather than\\nmounted on the instrument panel or other area within\\nthe flight deck. The mask-mounted regulator eliminates\\nthe problem of a long hose that must be purged of air\\nbefore 100 percent oxygen begins flowing into\\nthe mask.\\nCONTINUOUS FLOW OXYGEN SYSTEM\\nContinuous flow oxygen systems are usually provided\\nfor passengers. The passenger mask typically has a\\nreservoir bag, which collects oxygen from the\\ncontinuous flow oxygen system during the time when\\nthe mask user is exhaling. The oxygen collected in the\\nreservoir bag allows a higher aspiratory flow rate\\nduring the inhalation cycle, which reduces the amount\\nof air dilution. Ambient air is added to the supplied\\nFigure 5-32. Oxygen system regulator.\\nch 05.qxd  10/24/03  6:50 AM  Page 5-27'),\n",

[Figure 5-33]\\nSERVICING OF OXYGEN SYSTEMS\\nCertain precautions should be observed whenever\\naircraft oxygen systems are to be serviced. Before\\nservicing any aircraft with oxygen, consult the specific\\naircraft service manual to determine the type of\\nequipment required and procedures to be used. Oxygen\\nsystem servicing should be accomplished only when\\nthe aircraft is located outside of the hangars. Personal\\ncleanliness and good housekeeping are imperative\\nwhen working with oxygen. Oxygen under pressure\\nand petroleum products create spontaneous results\\nwhen they are brought in contact with each other.\\nService people should be certain to wash dirt, oil, and\\ngrease (including lip salves and hair oil) from their\\nhands before working around oxygen equipment. It is\\nalso essential that clothing and tools are free of oil,\\ngrease, and dirt. Aircraft with permanently installed\\noxygen tanks usually require two persons to\\naccomplish servicing of the system. One should be\\nstationed at the service equipment control valves, and\\nthe other stationed where he or she can observe the\\naircraft system pressure gauges. Oxygen system\\nservicing is not recommended during aircraft fueling\\noperations or while other work is performed that could\\nprovide a source of ignition. Oxygen system servicing\\nwhile passengers are on board the aircraft is\\nnot recommended.\\nICE CONTROL SYSTEMS\\nIce control systems installed on aircraft consist of\\nanti-ice and de-ice equipment. Anti-icing equipment is\\ndesigned to prevent the formation of ice, while de-icing\\nequipment is designed to remove ice once it has\\nformed. Ice control systems protect the leading edge of\\nwing and tail surfaces, pitot and static port openings,\\nfuel tank vents, stall warning devices, windshields, and\\npropeller blades. Ice detection lighting may also be\\ninstalled on some airplanes to determine the extent of\\nstructural icing during night flights. Since many\\nairplanes are not certified for flight in icing conditions,\\nrefer to the AFM or POH for details.\\nAIRFOIL ICE CONTROL\\nInflatable de-icing boots consist of a rubber sheet\\nbonded to the leading edge of the airfoil. When ice\\nbuilds up on the leading edge, an engine-driven\\npneumatic pump inflates the rubber boots. Some\\nturboprop aircraft divert engine bleed air to the wing to\\ninflate the rubber boots. Upon inflation, the ice is\\ncracked and should fall off the leading edge of the\\nwing. De-icing boots are controlled from the cockpit\\nby a switch and can be operated in a single cycle or\\nallowed to cycle at automatic, timed intervals. It is\\nimportant that de-icing boots are used in accordance\\nwith the manufacturer’s recommendations. If they are\\nallowed to cycle too often, ice can form over the\\ncontour of the boot and render the boots ineffective.\\n[Figure 5-34]\\nMany de-icing boot systems use the instrument system\\nsuction gauge and a pneumatic pressure gauge to\\nindicate proper boot operation. These gauges have\\nrange markings that indicate the operating limits for\\nboot operation. Some systems may also incorporate an\\nannunciator light to indicate proper boot operation.\\nProper maintenance and care of de-icing boots is\\nimportant for continued operation of this system. They\\nneed to be carefully inspected prior to a flight.\\nAnother type of leading edge protection is the thermal\\nanti-ice system installed on airplanes with turbine\\nengines. This system is designed to prevent the buildup\\nof ice by directing hot air from the compressor section\\nof the engine to the leading edge surfaces. The system\\nis activated prior to entering icing conditions. The hot\\nair heats the leading edge sufficiently to prevent the\\nformation of ice.\\nOronasal Mask \\nRebreather Bag\\nFigure 5-33.

The weeping-wing design\\nuses small holes located in the leading edge of the\\nwing. A chemical mixture is pumped to the leading\\nedge and weeps out through the holes to prevent the\\nformation and buildup of ice.\\nWINDSCREEN ICE CONTROL\\nThere are two main types of windscreen anti-ice\\nsystems. The first system directs a flow of alcohol to\\nthe windscreen. By using it early enough, the alcohol\\nwill prevent ice from building up on the windshield.\\nThe rate of alcohol flow can be controlled by a dial in\\nthe cockpit according to procedures recommended by\\nthe airplane manufacturer.\\nAnother effective method of anti-icing equipment is\\nthe electric heating method. Small wires or other\\nconductive material is imbedded in the windscreen.\\nThe heater can be turned on by a switch in the cockpit,\\nat which time electrical current is passed across the\\nshield through the wires to provide sufficient heat to\\nprevent the formation of ice on the windscreen. The\\nelectrical current can cause compass deviation errors;\\nin some cases, as much as 40°. The heated windscreen\\nshould only be used during flight. Do not leave it on\\nduring ground operations, as it can overheat and cause\\ndamage to the windscreen.\\nPROPELLER ICE CONTROL\\nPropellers are protected from icing by use of alcohol or\\nelectrically heated elements. Some propellers are\\nequipped with a discharge nozzle that is pointed toward\\nthe root of the blade. Alcohol is discharged from the\\nnozzles, and centrifugal force makes the alcohol flow\\ndown the leading edge of the blade. This prevents ice\\nfrom forming on the leading edge of the propeller.\\nPropellers can also be fitted with propeller anti-ice\\nboots. The propeller boot is divided into two sections—\\nthe inboard and the outboard sections. The boots are\\ngrooved to help direct the flow of alcohol, and they are\\nalso imbedded with electrical wires that carry current\\nfor heating the propeller. The prop anti-ice system can\\nbe monitored for proper operation by monitoring the\\nprop anti-ice ammeter. During the preflight inspection,\\ncheck the propeller boots for proper operation. If a boot\\nfails to heat one blade, an unequal blade loading can\\nresult, and may cause severe propeller vibration.\\n[Figure 5-35]\\nOTHER ICE CONTROL SYSTEMS\\nPitot and static ports, fuel vents, stall-warning sensors,\\nand other optional equipment may be heated by\\nelectrical elements. Operational checks of the\\nelectrically heated systems are to be checked in\\naccordance with the AFM or POH.\\nOperation of aircraft anti-icing and de-icing systems\\nshould be checked prior to encountering icing\\nconditions. Encounters with structural ice require\\nimmediate remedial action. Anti-icing and de-icing\\nequipment is not intended to sustain long-term flight in\\nicing conditions.\\nTURBINE ENGINES\\nThe turbine engine produces thrust by increasing the\\nvelocity of the air flowing through the engine. It consists\\nof an air inlet, compressor, combustion chambers, tur-\\nbine section, and exhaust.

The compressor types fall into\\nthree categories—centrifugal flow, axial flow, and\\ncentrifugal-axial flow. Compression of inlet air is\\nachieved in a centrifugal flow engine by accelerating\\nair outward perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of\\nthe machine. The axial-flow engine compresses air by\\na series of rotating and stationary airfoils moving the\\nair parallel to the longitudinal axis. The centrifugal-\\naxial flow design uses both kinds of compressors to\\nachieve the desired compression.\\nThe path the air takes through the engine and how\\npower is produced determines the type of engine. There\\nare four types of aircraft turbine engines—turbojet,\\nturboprop, turbofan, and turboshaft.\\nTURBOJET\\nThe turbojet engine contains four sections: compressor,\\ncombustion chamber, turbine section, and exhaust. The\\ncompressor section passes inlet air at a high rate of\\nspeed to the combustion chamber. The combustion\\nchamber contains the fuel inlet and igniter for\\ncombustion. The expanding air drives a turbine, which\\nis connected by a shaft to the compressor, sustaining\\nengine operation. The accelerated exhaust gases from\\nthe engine provide thrust. This is a basic application of\\ncompressing air, igniting the fuel-air mixture,\\nproducing power to self-sustain the engine operation,\\nand exhaust for propulsion.\\nTurbojet engines are limited on range and endurance.\\nThey are also slow to respond to throttle applications at\\nslow compressor speeds.\\nTURBOPROP\\nA turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives a\\npropeller through a reduction gear. The exhaust gases\\ndrive a power turbine connected by a shaft that drives\\nthe reduction gear assembly. Reduction gearing is\\nnecessary in turboprop engines because optimum\\npropeller performance is achieved at much slower\\nspeeds than the engine’s operating r.p.m. Turboprop\\nengines are a compromise between turbojet engines\\nand reciprocating powerplants. Turboprop engines are\\nmost efficient at speeds between 250 and 400 m.p.h.\\nand altitudes between 18,000 and 30,000 feet. They\\nalso perform well at the slow airspeeds required for\\ntakeoff and landing, and are fuel efficient. The mini-\\nmum specific fuel consumption of the turboprop engine\\nis normally available in the altitude range of 25,000\\nfeet to the tropopause.\\nTURBOFAN\\nTurbofans were developed to combine some of the best\\nfeatures of the turbojet and the turboprop. Turbofan\\nengines are designed to create additional thrust by\\ndiverting a secondary airflow around the combustion\\nchamber. The turbofan bypass air generates increased\\nthrust, cools the engine, and aids in exhaust noise\\nsuppression. This provides turbojet-type cruise speed\\nand lower fuel consumption.\\nThe inlet air that passes through a turbofan engine is\\nusually divided into two separate streams of air. One\\nstream passes through the engine core, while a second\\nstream bypasses the engine core. It is this bypass\\nstream of air that is responsible for the term “bypass\\nengine.” A turbofan’s bypass ratio refers to the ratio of\\nthe mass airflow that passes through the fan divided by\\nthe mass airflow that passes through the engine core.\\nFigure 5-36.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='5-31\\nTURBOSHAFT\\nThe fourth common type of jet engine is the turboshaft.\\nIt delivers power to a shaft that drives something other\\nthan a propeller. The biggest difference between a\\nturbojet and turboshaft engine is that on a turboshaft\\nengine, most of the energy produced by the expanding\\ngases is used to drive a turbine rather than produce\\nthrust. Many helicopters use a turboshaft gas turbine\\nengine. In addition, turboshaft engines are widely used\\nas auxiliary power units on large aircraft.\\nPERFORMANCE COMPARISON\\nIt is possible to compare the performance of a\\nreciprocating powerplant and different types of turbine\\nengines. However, for the comparison to be accurate,\\nthrust horsepower (usable horsepower) for the\\nreciprocating powerplant must be used rather than\\nbrake horsepower, and net thrust must be used for the\\nturbine-powered engines. In addition, aircraft design\\nconfiguration, and size must be approximately\\nthe same.\\nBHP— Brake horsepower is the horsepower \\nactually delivered to the output shaft. \\nBrake horsepower is the actual usable \\nhorsepower.\\nNet Thrust— The thrust produced by a turbojet or\\nturbofan engine.\\nTHP— Thrust horsepower is the horsepower\\nequivalent of the thrust produced by a \\nturbojet or turbofan engine.\\nESHP— Equivalent shaft horsepower, with \\nrespect to turboprop engines, is the \\nsum of the shaft horsepower (SHP) \\ndelivered to the propeller and the \\nthrust horsepower (THP) produced by\\nthe exhaust gases.\\nFigure 5-37 shows how four types of engines compare\\nin net thrust as airspeed is increased. This figure is for\\nexplanatory purposes only and is not for specific\\nmodels of engines. The four types of engines are:\\n• Reciprocating powerplant.\\n• Turbine, propeller combination (turboprop).\\n• Turbine engine incorporating a fan (turbofan).\\n• Turbojet (pure jet).\\nThe comparison is made by plotting the performance\\ncurve for each engine, which shows how maximum\\naircraft speed varies with the type of engine used. Since\\nthe graph is only a means of comparison, numerical\\nvalues for net thrust, aircraft speed, and drag are\\nnot included.\\nComparison of the four powerplants on the basis of net\\nthrust makes certain performance capabilities evident.\\nIn the speed range shown to the left of Line A, the\\nreciprocating powerplant outperforms the other three\\ntypes. The turboprop outperforms the turbofan in the\\nrange to the left of Line C. The turbofan engine\\noutperforms the turbojet in the range to the left of Line\\nF. The turbofan engine outperforms the reciprocating\\npowerplant to the right of Line B and the turboprop to\\nthe right of Line C. The turbojet outperforms the\\nreciprocating powerplant to the right of Line D, the\\nturboprop to the right of Line E, and the turbofan to the\\nright of Line F.\\nThe points where the aircraft drag curve intersects the\\nnet thrust curves are the maximum aircraft speeds. The\\nvertical lines from each of the points to the baseline of\\nthe graph indicate that the turbojet aircraft can attain a\\nhigher maximum speed than aircraft equipped with the\\nother types of engines. Aircraft equipped with the\\nturbofan engine will attain a higher maximum\\nspeed than aircraft equipped with a turboprop or\\nreciprocating powerplant.\\nTURBINE ENGINE INSTRUMENTS\\nEngine instruments that indicate oil pressure, oil temper-\\nature, engine speed, exhaust gas temperature, and fuel\\nflow are common to both turbine and reciprocating\\nengines. However, there are some instruments that are\\nunique to turbine engines. These instruments provide\\nindications of engine pressure ratio, turbine discharge\\npressure, and torque. In addition, most gas turbine\\nengines have multiple temperature-sensing instruments,\\ncalled thermocouples, that provide pilots with\\ntemperature readings in and around the turbine section.\\nAircraft Drag\\nAirspeed\\nNet Thrust\\nA\\nC\\nB\\nD\\nE F\\nTurbojet\\nTurbofan\\nTurboprop\\nReciprocating\\nFigure 5-37.

Pressure measurements are recorded by\\nprobes installed in the engine inlet and at the exhaust.\\nOnce collected, the data is sent to a differential\\npressure transducer, which is indicated on a cockpit\\nEPR gauge.\\nEPR system design automatically compensates for the\\neffects of airspeed and altitude. However, changes in\\nambient temperature do require a correction to be\\napplied to EPR indications to provide accurate engine\\npower settings.\\nEXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE\\nA limiting factor in a gas turbine engine is the\\ntemperature of the turbine section. The temperature of\\na turbine section must be monitored closely to prevent\\noverheating the turbine blades and other exhaust\\nsection components. One common way of monitoring\\nthe temperature of a turbine section is with an exhaust\\ngas temperature (EGT) gauge. EGT is an engine\\noperating limit used to monitor overall engine\\noperating conditions.\\nVariations of EGT systems bear different names based\\non the location of the temperature sensors. Common tur-\\nbine temperature sensing gauges include the turbine inlet\\ntemperature (TIT) gauge, turbine outlet temperature\\n(TOT) gauge, interstage turbine temperature (ITT)\\ngauge, and turbine gas temperature (TGT) gauge.\\nTORQUEMETER\\nTurboprop/turboshaft engine power output is measured\\nby the torquemeter. Torque is a twisting force applied\\nto a shaft. The torquemeter measures power applied to\\nthe shaft. Turboprop and turboshaft engines are\\ndesigned to produce torque for driving a propeller.\\nTorquemeters are calibrated in percentage units,\\nfoot-pounds, or pounds per square inch.\\nN1 INDICATOR\\nN1 represents the rotational speed of the low pressure\\ncompressor and is presented on the indicator as a\\npercentage of design r.p.m. After start the speed of the\\nlow pressure compressor is governed by the N\\n1 turbine\\nwheel. The N 1 turbine wheel is connected to the low\\npressure compressor through a concentric shaft.\\nN2 INDICATOR\\nN2 represents the rotational speed of the high pressure\\ncompressor and is presented on the indicator as a\\npercentage of design r.p.m. The high pressure\\ncompressor is governed by the N\\n2 turbine wheel. The\\nN2 turbine wheel is connected to the high pressure\\ncompressor through a concentric shaft. [Figure 5-38]\\nTURBINE ENGINE OPERATIONAL\\nCONSIDERATIONS\\nBecause of the great variety of turbine engines, it is\\nimpractical to cover specific operational procedures.\\nHowever, there are certain operational considerations\\nthat are common to all turbine engines. They are engine\\ntemperature limits, foreign object damage, hot start,\\ncompressor stall, and flameout.\\nENGINE TEMPERATURE LIMITATIONS\\nThe highest temperature in any turbine engine occurs\\nat the turbine inlet. Turbine inlet temperature is\\ntherefore usually the limiting factor in turbine\\nengine operation.\\nTHRUST VARIATIONS\\nTurbine engine thrust varies directly with air density.\\nAs air density decreases, so does thrust. While both\\nturbine and reciprocating powered engines are affected\\nto some degree by high relative humidity, turbine\\nengines will experience a negligible loss of thrust,\\nwhile reciprocating engines a significant loss of brake\\nhorsepower.\\nFOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE\\nDue to the design and function of a turbine engine’s air\\ninlet, the possibility of ingestion of debris always\\nexists. This causes significant damage, particularly to\\nthe compressor and turbine sections. When this occurs,\\nit is called foreign object damage (FOD). Typical FOD\\nconsists of small nicks and dents caused by ingestion\\nof small objects from the ramp, taxiway, or runway.\\nHowever, FOD damage caused by bird strikes or ice\\ningestion can also occur, and may result in total\\ndestruction of an engine.\\nPrevention of FOD is a high priority. Some engine\\ninlets have a tendency to form a vortex between the\\nground and the inlet during ground operations. A\\nvortex dissipater may be installed on these engines.\\nConcentric Shaft—One shaft inside another shaft having a common core.\\nLow Pressure\\nCompressor (N1)\\nHigh Pressure\\nCompressor\\nDrive Shaft\\nHigh Pressure\\nCompressor (N\\n2)\\nLow Pressure\\nCompressor\\nDrive Shaft\\nFigure 5-38.

Preflight procedures include a visual\\ninspection for any sign of FOD.\\nTURBINE ENGINE HOT/HUNG START\\nA hot start is when the EGT exceeds the safe limit. Hot\\nstarts are caused by too much fuel entering the\\ncombustion chamber, or insufficient turbine r.p.m. Any\\ntime an engine has a hot start, refer to the AFM, POH,\\nor an appropriate maintenance manual for inspection\\nrequirements.\\nIf the engine fails to accelerate to the proper speed after\\nignition or does not accelerate to idle r.p.m., a hung\\nstart has occurred. A hung start, may also be called a\\nfalse start. A hung start may be caused by an\\ninsufficient starting power source or fuel control\\nmalfunction.\\nCOMPRESSOR STALLS\\nCompressor blades are small airfoils and are subject to\\nthe same aerodynamic principles that apply to any\\nairfoil. A compressor blade has an angle of attack. The\\nangle of attack is a result of inlet air velocity and the\\ncompressor’s rotational velocity. These two forces\\ncombine to form a vector, which defines the airfoil’s\\nactual angle of attack to the approaching inlet air.\\nA compressor stall can be described as an imbalance\\nbetween the two vector quantities, inlet velocity and\\ncompressor rotational speed. Compressor stalls occur\\nwhen the compressor blades’ angle of attack exceeds\\nthe critical angle of attack. At this point, smooth\\nairflow is interrupted and turbulence is created with\\npressure fluctuations. Compressor stalls cause air\\nflowing in the compressor to slow down and stagnate,\\nsometimes reversing direction. [Figure 5-39]\\nCompressor stalls can be transient and\\nintermittent or steady state and severe. Indications of a\\ntransient/intermittent stall are usually an intermittent\\n“bang” as backfire and flow reversal take place. If the\\nstall develops and becomes steady, strong vibration and\\na loud roar may develop from the continuous flow\\nreversal. Quite often the cockpit gauges will not show a\\nmild or transient stall, but will indicate a developed\\nstall. Typical instrument indications include\\nfluctuations in r.p.m., and an increase in exhaust gas\\ntemperature. Most transient stalls are not harmful to the\\nengine and often correct themselves after one or two\\npulsations. The possibility of engine damage, which\\nmay be severe, from a steady state stall is immediate.\\nRecovery must be accomplished quickly by reducing\\npower, decreasing the airplane’s angle of attack and\\nincreasing airspeed.\\nAlthough all gas turbine engines are subject to\\ncompressor stalls, most models have systems that\\ninhibit these stalls. One such system uses variable inlet\\nguide vane (VIGV) and variable stator vanes, which\\ndirect the incoming air into the rotor blades at an\\nappropriate angle. The main way to prevent air\\npressure stalls is to operate the airplane within the\\nparameters established by the manufacturer. If a\\ncompressor stall does develop, follow the procedures\\nrecommended in the AFM or POH.\\nFLAMEOUT\\nA flameout is a condition in the operation of a gas\\nturbine engine in which the fire in the engine\\nunintentionally goes out. If the rich limit of the fuel/air\\nratio is exceeded in the combustion chamber, the flame\\nwill blow out. This condition is often referred to as a\\nrich flameout. It generally results from very fast engine\\nacceleration, where an overly rich mixture causes the\\nfuel temperature to drop below the combustion\\ntemperature. It also may be caused by insufficient\\nairflow to support combustion.\\nAnother, more common flameout occurrence is due to\\nlow fuel pressure and low engine speeds, which\\ntypically are associated with high-altitude flight. This\\nsituation also may occur with the engine throttled back\\nduring a descent, which can set up the lean-condition\\nflameout. A weak mixture can easily cause the flame to\\ndie out, even with a normal airflow through the engine.\\nAny interruption of the fuel supply also can result in a\\nflameout. This may be due to prolonged unusual\\nattitudes, a malfunctioning fuel control system,\\nturbulence, icing or running out of fuel.\\nSymptoms of a flameout normally are the same as\\nthose following an engine failure. If the flameout is due\\nto a transitory condition, such as an imbalance between\\nfuel flow and engine speed, an airstart may be\\nNormal Inlet\\nAirflow\\nDistorted Inlet\\nAirflow\\nFigure 5-39.

They provide the source of\\nambient air pressure for the operation of the \\naltimeter, vertical speed indicator (vertical velocity\\nindicator), and the airspeed indicator.  [Figure 6-1]\\nIMPACT PRESSURE CHAMBER AND LINES\\nIn this system, the impact air pressure (air striking the\\nairplane because of its forward motion) is taken from a\\npitot tube, which is mounted in locations that provide \\nminimum disturbance or turbulence caused by \\nthe motion of the airplane through the air. The static\\npressure (pressure of the still air) is usually taken from\\nthe static line attached to a vent or vents mounted flush\\nwith the side of the fuselage. This compensates for any\\npossible variation in static pressure due to erratic\\nchanges in airplane attitude. \\nThe openings of both the pitot tube and the static vent\\nmust be checked during the preflight inspection to\\nassure that they are free from obstructions. Blocked \\nor partially blocked openings should be cleaned by \\na certificated mechanic. Blowing into these openings is\\nnot recommended because this could damage the\\ninstruments.\\nAs the airplane moves through the air, the impact \\npressure on the open pitot tube affects the pressure in\\nthe pitot chamber. Any change of pressure in the pitot\\nchamber is transmitted through a line connected to the\\nairspeed indicator, which utilizes impact pressure for\\nits operation. \\nSTATIC PRESSURE CHAMBER AND LINES\\nThe static chamber is vented through small holes to \\nthe free undisturbed air, and as the atmospheric \\npressure increases or decreases, the pressure in \\nthe static chamber changes accordingly.

This source usually is vented to the pressure\\ninside the cockpit. Because of the venturi effect of \\nthe flow of air over the cockpit, this alternate static\\npressure is usually lower than the pressure provided \\nby the normal static air source. When the alternate\\nstatic source is used, the following differences in the\\ninstrument indications usually occur: the altimeter will\\nindicate higher than the actual altitude, the airspeed\\nwill indicate greater than the actual airspeed, and the\\nvertical speed will indicate a climb while in level flight.\\nConsult the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nOperating Handbook (AFM/POH) to determine the\\namount of error.\\nIf the airplane is not equipped with an alternate static\\nsource, breaking the glass seal of the vertical speed\\nindicator allows ambient air pressure to enter the static\\nsystem. This makes the VSI unusable.\\nALTIMETER\\nThe altimeter measures the height of the airplane above\\na given pressure level. Since it is the only instrument\\nthat gives altitude information, the altimeter is one\\nof the most vital instruments in the airplane. To use\\nthe altimeter effectively, its operation and how\\natmospheric pressure and temperature affect it must\\nbe thoroughly understood. A stack of sealed aneroid\\nwafers comprises the main component of the altime-\\nter. These wafers expand and contract with changes\\nin atmospheric pressure from the static source. The\\nmechanical linkage translates these changes into\\npointer movements on the indicator. [Figure 6-2]\\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\\nThe pressure altimeter is an aneroid barometer that\\nmeasures the pressure of the atmosphere at the level\\nwhere the altimeter is located, and presents an altitude\\nindication in feet. The altimeter uses static pressure as\\nits source of operation. Air is denser at sea level than\\naloft, so as altitude increases, atmospheric pressure\\ndecreases. This difference in pressure at various levels\\ncauses the altimeter to indicate changes in altitude.\\nThe presentation of altitude varies considerably\\nbetween different types of altimeters. Some have \\none pointer while others have two or more. Only the\\nmultipointer type will be discussed in this handbook.\\nThe dial of a typical altimeter is graduated with numer-\\nals arranged clockwise from 0 to 9. Movement of the\\naneroid element is transmitted through gears to \\nthe three hands that indicate altitude. The shortest \\nhand indicates altitude in tens of thousands of feet; the\\nintermediate hand in thousands of feet; and the longest\\nhand in hundreds of feet.\\nThis indicated altitude is correct, however, only when\\nthe sea level barometric pressure is standard (29.92\\ninches of mercury), the sea level free air temperature is\\nstandard (+15°C or 59°F), and the pressure and \\ntemperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase\\nin altitude. Adjustments for nonstandard conditions are\\naccomplished by setting the corrected pressure into a \\nbarometric scale located on the face of the altimeter.\\nOnly after the altimeter is set does it indicate the \\ncorrect altitude.\\nEFFECT OF NONSTANDARD PRESSURE \\nAND TEMPERATURE\\nIf no means were provided for adjusting altimeters to\\nnonstandard pressure, flight could be hazardous. For\\nexample, if flying from a high-pressure area to a \\nlow-pressure area without adjusting the altimeter, the\\nactual altitude of the airplane would be LOWER than\\nthe indicated altitude. An old saying, “HIGH TO LOW,\\nLOOK OUT BELOW” is a way of remembering which\\ncondition is dangerous. When flying from a low-pres-\\nsure area to a high-pressure area without adjusting the\\naltimeter, the actual altitude of the airplane is HIGHER\\nthan the indicated altitude.\\nFigure 6-3 shows how variations in air temperature also\\naffect the altimeter. On a warm day, a given mass of air\\nexpands to a larger volume than on a cold day, raising\\nthe pressure levels. For example, the pressure level\\nwhere the altimeter indicates 5,000 feet is HIGHER on\\na warm day than under standard conditions. On a cold\\nday, the reverse is true, and the pressure level where the\\naltimeter indicates 5,000 feet is LOWER.\\nThe adjustment to compensate for nonstandard pres-\\nsure does not compensate for nonstandard temperature.\\nAneroid\\nWafers\\nAltimeter\\nSetting Window\\nAltitude\\nIndication\\nScale\\n10,000 ft\\n  Pointer\\n1,000 ft\\nPointer\\n100 ft Pointer\\nAltimeter Setting \\nAdjustment Knob\\nCrosshatch\\nFlag\\nA crosshatched\\narea appears\\non some altimeters\\nwhen displaying\\nan altitude below\\n10,000 feet MSL.\\nStatic Port\\nFigure 6-2.

Therefore, it is necessary to use a\\nhigher indicated altitude to provide adequate terrain\\nclearance. Modify the memory aid to “HIGH TO LOW\\nOR HOT TO COLD, LOOK OUT BELOW.”\\nSETTING THE ALTIMETER\\nMost altimeters are equipped with a barometric \\npressure setting window (sometimes referred to as the\\nKollsman window) providing a means to adjust the\\naltimeter. A knob is located at the bottom of the instru-\\nment for this adjustment. \\nTo adjust the altimeter for variation in atmospheric\\npressure, the pressure scale in the altimeter setting \\nwindow, calibrated in inches of mercury (in. Hg) and/or\\nmillibars (Mb), is adjusted to match the given altimeter\\nsetting. Altimeter setting is defined as station pressure\\nreduced to sea level. However, an altimeter setting is\\naccurate only in the vicinity of the reporting station.\\nTherefore, the altimeter must be adjusted as the flight\\nprogresses from one station to the next.\\nMany pilots confidently expect that the current altimeter\\nsetting will compensate for irregularities in atmospheric\\npressure at all altitudes, but this is not always true. The\\naltimeter setting broadcast by ground stations is the \\nstation pressure corrected to mean sea level. It does not\\naccount for the irregularities at higher levels, particu-\\nlarly the effect of nonstandard temperature. However, if\\neach pilot in a given area is using the same altimeter \\nsetting, each altimeter should be equally affected by \\ntemperature and pressure variation errors, making it \\npossible to maintain the desired vertical separation\\nbetween aircraft.\\nWhen flying over high, mountainous terrain, certain\\natmospheric conditions can cause the altimeter to \\nindicate an altitude of 1,000 feet, or more, HIGHER\\nthan the actual altitude. For this reason, a generous\\nmargin of altitude should be allowed—not only \\nfor possible altimeter error, but also for possible \\ndowndrafts that might be associated with high winds.\\nTo illustrate the use of the altimeter setting system, \\nfollow a flight from Dallas Love Field, Texas to\\nAbilene Municipal Airport, Texas via Mineral Wells.\\nBefore taking off from Love Field, the pilot receives a\\ncurrent altimeter setting of 29.85 from the control\\ntower or automatic terminal information service\\n(ATIS), and sets this value in the altimeter setting \\n   5,000-foot pressure level\\n   4,000-foot pressure level\\n   3,000-foot pressure level\\n   2,000-foot pressure level\\n   1,000-foot pressure level\\n   Sea level\\n 30°C                                   15°C                                      0°C\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nTrue \\nAltitude\\nFigure 6-3.

The altimeter indication should then be \\ncompared with the known airport elevation of 487 feet.\\nSince most altimeters are not perfectly calibrated, an\\nerror may exist. \\nWhen over Mineral Wells, assume the pilot receives a\\ncurrent altimeter setting of 29.94 and sets this in the\\naltimeter window. Before entering the traffic pattern at\\nAbilene Municipal Airport, a new altimeter setting of\\n29.69 is received from the Abilene Control Tower, and\\nset in the altimeter setting window. If the pilot desires\\nto fly the traffic pattern at approximately 800 feet\\nabove the terrain, and the field elevation of Abilene is\\n1,791 feet, an indicated altitude of 2,600 feet should be\\nmaintained (1,791 feet + 800 feet = 2,591 feet rounded\\nto 2,600 feet).\\nThe importance of properly setting the altimeter cannot\\nbe overemphasized. Assume that the pilot did not\\nadjust the altimeter at Abilene to the current setting,\\nand continued using the Mineral Wells setting of 29.94.\\nWhen entering the Abilene traffic pattern at an \\nindicated altitude of 2,600 feet, the airplane would be\\napproximately 250 feet below the proper traffic pattern\\naltitude. Upon landing, the altimeter would indicate\\napproximately 250 feet higher than the field elevation.\\nAltimeter setting 29.94\\nCurrent altimeter setting 29.69\\nDifference .25\\n(Since 1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately\\n1,000 feet of altitude, .25 �1,000 feet = 250 feet.)\\nWhen determining whether to add or subtract the\\namount of altimeter error, remember that, when the\\nactual pressure is lower than what is set in the altimeter\\nwindow, the actual altitude of the airplane will be lower\\nthan what is indicated on the altimeter. \\nALTIMETER OPERATION\\nThere are two means by which the altimeter pointers\\ncan be moved. The first is a change in air pressure,\\nwhile the other is an adjustment to the barometric \\nscale. When the airplane climbs or descends, changing\\npressure within the altimeter case expands or contracts\\nthe aneroid barometer. This movement is transmitted\\nthrough mechanical linkage to rotate the pointers. A\\ndecrease in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate an\\nincrease in altitude, and an increase in pressure causes\\nthe altimeter to indicate a decrease in altitude.\\nAccordingly, if the airplane is flown from a pressure\\nlevel of 28.75 in. Hg. to a pressure level of 29.75 \\nin. Hg., the altimeter would show a decrease of \\napproximately 1,000 feet in altitude.\\nThe other method of moving the pointers does not\\nrely on changing air pressure, but the mechanical\\nconstruction of the altimeter. Do not be confused by\\nthe fact that as the barometric pressure scale is\\nmoved, the indicator needles move in the same\\ndirection, which is opposite to the reaction the\\npointers have when air pressure changes. To illus-\\ntrate this point, suppose the pilot lands at an airport\\nwith an elevation of 1,000 feet and the altimeter is\\ncorrectly set to the current sea level pressure of\\n30.00 in. Hg. While the airplane is parked on the\\nramp, the pressure decreases to 29.50. The altimeter\\nsenses this as a climb and now indicates 1,500 feet.\\nWhen returning to the airplane, if the setting in the\\naltimeter window is decreased to the current sea\\nlevel pressure of 29.50, the indication will be\\nreduced back down to 1,000 feet. \\nKnowing the airplane’s altitude is vitally important\\nto a pilot. The pilot must be sure that the airplane is\\nflying high enough to clear the highest terrain or\\nobstruction along the intended route. It is especially\\nimportant to have accurate altitude information when\\nvisibility is restricted. To clear obstructions, the pilot\\nmust constantly be aware of the altitude of the air-\\nplane and the elevation of the surrounding terrain. To\\nreduce the possibility of a midair collision, it is\\nessential to maintain altitude in accordance with air\\ntraffic rules.\\nTYPES OF ALTITUDE \\nAltitude is vertical distance above some point or level\\nused as a reference. There are as many kinds of altitude\\nas there are reference levels from which altitude is\\nmeasured, and each may be used for specific reasons.\\nPilots are mainly concerned with five types of altitudes:\\nIndicated Altitude— That altitude read directly from\\nthe altimeter (uncorrected) when it is set to the current\\naltimeter setting.\\nTrue Altitude— The vertical distance of the airplane\\nabove sea level—the actual altitude. It is often\\nexpressed as feet above mean sea level (MSL). Airport,\\nterrain, and obstacle elevations on aeronautical charts\\nare true altitudes.\\nAbsolute Altitude— The vertical distance of an air-\\nplane above the terrain, or above ground level (AGL).\\nPressure Altitude— The altitude indicated when the\\naltimeter setting window (barometric scale) is adjusted\\nto 29.92. This is the altitude above the standard datum\\nplane, which is a theoretical plane where air pressure\\nCh 06.qxd  10/24/03  6:55 AM  Page 6-4'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='6-5\\n(corrected to 15°C) equals 29.92 in. Hg. Pressure \\naltitude is used to compute density altitude, true \\naltitude, true airspeed, and other performance data.\\nDensity Altitude— This altitude is pressure altitude\\ncorrected for variations from standard temperature.\\nWhen conditions are standard, pressure altitude and\\ndensity altitude are the same. If the temperature is\\nabove standard, the density altitude is higher than \\npressure altitude. If the temperature is below standard,\\nthe density altitude is lower than pressure altitude. This\\nis an important altitude because it is directly related to\\nthe airplane’s performance.\\nAs an example, consider an airport with a field \\nelevation of 5,048 feet MSL where the standard \\ntemperature is 5°C. Under these conditions, pressure\\naltitude and density altitude are the same—5,048 feet.\\nIf the temperature changes to 30°C, the density \\naltitude increases to 7,855 feet. This means an airplane\\nwould perform on takeoff as though the field elevation\\nwere 7,855 feet at standard temperature. Conversely, a\\ntemperature of -25°C would result in a density altitude\\nof 1,232 feet. An airplane would have much better \\nperformance under these conditions.\\nInstrument Check— To determine the condition of \\nan altimeter, set the barometric scale to the altimeter\\nsetting transmitted by the local automated flight \\nservice station (AFSS) or any other reliable source. The\\naltimeter pointers should indicate the surveyed eleva-\\ntion of the airport. If the indication is off more than 75\\nfeet from the surveyed elevation, the instrument\\nshould be referred to a certificated instrument repair\\nstation for recalibration.\\nVERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR\\nThe vertical speed indicator (VSI), which is sometimes\\ncalled a vertical velocity indicator (VVI), indicates\\nwhether the airplane is climbing, descending, or in level\\nflight. The rate of climb or descent is indicated in feet\\nper minute. If properly calibrated, the VSI indicates zero\\nin level flight. [Figure 6-4]\\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\\nAlthough the vertical speed indicator operates solely\\nfrom static pressure, it is a differential pressure \\ninstrument. It contains a diaphragm with connecting\\nlinkage and gearing to the indicator pointer inside an\\nairtight case. The inside of the diaphragm is connected\\ndirectly to the static line of the pitot-static system. \\nThe area outside the diaphragm, which is inside the\\ninstrument case, is also connected to the static line, but\\nthrough a restricted orifice (calibrated leak).\\nBoth the diaphragm and the case receive air from the\\nstatic line at existing atmospheric pressure. When the\\nairplane is on the ground or in level flight, the pressures\\ninside the diaphragm and the instrument case remain\\nthe same and the pointer is at the zero indication. When\\nthe airplane climbs or descends, the pressure inside \\nthe diaphragm changes immediately, but due to the\\nmetering action of the restricted passage, the case \\npressure remains higher or lower for a short time, \\ncausing the diaphragm to contract or expand. This\\ncauses a pressure differential that is indicated on the\\ninstrument needle as a climb or descent. When the \\npressure differential stabilizes at a definite ratio, the\\nneedle indicates the rate of altitude change. \\nThe vertical speed indicator is capable of displaying\\ntwo different types of information:\\n• Trend information shows an immediate indica-\\ntion of an increase or decrease in the airplane’s\\nrate of climb or descent.\\n• Rate information shows a stabilized rate of\\nchange in altitude.\\nFor example, if maintaining a steady 500-foot per\\nminute (f.p.m.) climb, and the nose is lowered\\nslightly, the VSI immediately senses this change and\\nindicates a decrease in the rate of climb. This first\\nindication is called the trend. After a short time, the\\nVSI needle stabilizes on the new rate of climb, which\\nin this example, is something less than 500 f.p.m. The\\ntime from the initial change in the rate of climb, until\\nthe VSI displays an accurate indication of the new\\nrate, is called the lag. Rough control technique and\\nturbulence can extend the lag period and cause erratic\\nand unstable rate indications. Some airplanes are\\nDiaphragm\\nDirect Static\\nPressure\\nCalibrated\\nLeak\\nFigure 6-4. Vertical speed indicator.\\nCh 06.qxd  10/24/03  6:55 AM  Page 6-5'),\n",

[Figure 6-5]\\nInstrument Check— To verify proper operation, make\\nsure the VSI is indicating near zero prior to takeoff.\\nAfter takeoff, it should indicate a positive rate of climb. \\nAIRSPEED INDICATOR\\nThe airspeed indicator is a sensitive, differential pres-\\nsure gauge which measures and shows promptly the\\ndifference between pitot or impact pressure, and static\\npressure, the undisturbed atmospheric pressure at level\\nflight. These two pressures will be equal when the \\nairplane is parked on the ground in calm air. When \\nthe airplane moves through the air, the pressure on the\\npitot line becomes greater than the pressure in the static\\nlines. This difference in pressure is registered by the\\nairspeed pointer on the face of the instrument,\\nwhich is calibrated in miles per hour, knots, or both.\\n[Figure 6-6]\\nPilots should understand the following speeds:\\nIndicated Airspeed (IAS)— The direct instrument\\nreading obtained from the airspeed indicator, \\nuncorrected for variations in atmospheric density,\\ninstallation error, or instrument error. Manufacturers\\nuse this airspeed as the basis for determining airplane\\nperformance. Takeoff, landing, and stall speeds listed\\nin the AFM or POH are indicated airspeeds and do not\\nnormally vary with altitude or temperature.\\nCalibrated Airspeed (CAS)— Indicated airspeed \\ncorrected for installation error and instrument error.\\nAlthough manufacturers attempt to keep airspeed\\nerrors to a minimum, it is not possible to eliminate \\nall errors throughout the airspeed operating range. At\\ncertain airspeeds and with certain flap settings, the\\ninstallation and instrument errors may total several\\nknots. This error is generally greatest at low airspeeds.\\nIn the cruising and higher airspeed ranges, indicated\\nairspeed and calibrated airspeed are approximately the\\nsame. Refer to the airspeed calibration chart to correct\\nfor possible airspeed errors. \\nTrue Airspeed (TAS)—Calibrated airspeed corrected\\nfor altitude and nonstandard temperature. Because air\\ndensity decreases with an increase in altitude, an \\nairplane has to be flown faster at higher altitudes to\\ncause the same pressure difference between pitot\\nimpact pressure and static pressure. Therefore, for a\\ngiven calibrated airspeed, true airspeed increases as\\naltitude increases; or for a given true airspeed, \\ncalibrated airspeed decreases as altitude increases.\\nA pilot can find true airspeed by two methods. The\\nmost accurate method is to use a flight computer. With\\nthis method, the calibrated airspeed is corrected \\nfor temperature and pressure variation by using the \\nairspeed correction scale on the computer. Extremely\\naccurate electronic flight computers are also available.\\nJust enter the CAS, pressure altitude, and temperature\\nand the computer calculates the true airspeed.\\nA second method, which is a “rule of thumb,” will \\nprovide the approximate true airspeed. Simply add 2 \\npercent to the calibrated airspeed for each 1,000 feet of\\naltitude.\\nGroundspeed (GS)— The actual speed of the airplane\\nover the ground. It is true airspeed adjusted for wind.\\nGroundspeed decreases with a headwind, and increases\\nwith a tailwind.\\nAIRSPEED INDICATOR MARKINGS\\nAirplanes weighing 12,500 pounds or less, manufac-\\ntured after 1945, and certificated by the FAA, \\nare required to have airspeed indicators marked in\\naccordance with a standard color-coded marking \\nKnots—Nautical miles per hour.\\nDiaphragm\\nStatic Air Line\\nRam Air\\nPitot Tube\\nFigure 6-6.

This system of color-coded markings enables\\na pilot to determine at a glance certain airspeed limi-\\ntations that are important to the safe operation of the\\nairplane. For example, if during the execution of a\\nmaneuver, it is noted that the airspeed needle is in the\\nyellow arc and rapidly approaching the red line, the\\nimmediate reaction should be to reduce airspeed. \\nAs shown in figure 6-7, airspeed indicators on single-\\nengine small airplanes include the following standard\\ncolor-coded markings:\\n• White arc—This arc is commonly referred to \\nas the flap operating range since its lower limit\\nrepresents the full flap stall speed and its upper\\nlimit provides the maximum flap speed.\\nApproaches and landings are usually flown at\\nspeeds within the white arc.\\n• Lower limit of white arc (V\\nS0)—The stalling\\nspeed or the minimum steady flight speed in the\\nlanding configuration. In small airplanes, this is\\nthe power-off stall speed at the maximum landing\\nweight in the landing configuration (gear and\\nflaps down).\\n• Upper limit of the white arc (V\\nFE)—The maxi-\\nmum speed with the flaps extended.\\n• Green arc—This is the normal operating range of\\nthe airplane. Most flying occurs within this range.\\n• Lower limit of green arc (V S1)—The stalling\\nspeed or the minimum steady flight speed\\nobtained in a specified configuration. For most\\nairplanes, this is the power-off stall speed at the\\nmaximum takeoff weight in the clean configuration\\n(gear up, if retractable, and flaps up). \\n• Upper limit of green arc (V NO)—The maximum\\nstructural cruising speed. Do not exceed this\\nspeed except in smooth air.\\n• Yellow arc—Caution range. Fly within this range\\nonly in smooth air, and then, only with caution.\\n• Red line (V\\nNE)—Never-exceed speed. Operating\\nabove this speed is prohibited since it may result\\nin damage or structural failure.\\nOTHER AIRSPEED LIMITATIONS\\nSome important airspeed limitations are not marked on the\\nface of the airspeed indicator, but are found on placards\\nand in the AFM or POH. These airspeeds include:\\n• Design maneuvering speed (V\\nA)—This is the\\n“rough air” speed and the maximum speed for abrupt\\nmaneuvers. If during flight, rough air or severe \\nturbulence is encountered, reduce the airspeed to\\nmaneuvering speed or less to minimize stress on the\\nairplane structure. It is important to consider weight\\nwhen referencing this speed. For example, V\\nA may\\nbe 100 knots when an airplane is heavily loaded, but\\nonly 90 knots when the load is light.\\n• Landing gear operating speed (V\\nLO)—The\\nmaximum speed for extending or retracting the\\nlanding gear if using an airplane equipped with\\nretractable landing gear.\\n• Landing gear extended speed (V\\nLE)—The\\nmaximum speed at which an airplane can be\\nsafely flown with the landing gear extended. \\n• Best angle-of-climb speed (V\\nX)—The airspeed at\\nwhich an airplane gains the greatest amount of\\naltitude in a given distance. It is used during a\\nshort-field takeoff to clear an obstacle.\\n• Best rate-of-climb speed (V\\nY)—This airspeed\\nprovides the most altitude gain in a given period\\nof time. \\n• Minimum control speed (V\\nMC)—This is the min-\\nimum flight speed at which a light, twin-engine\\nairplane can be satisfactorily controlled when an\\nengine suddenly becomes inoperative and the\\nremaining engine is at takeoff power.\\n• Best rate of climb with one engine inoperative\\n(V\\nYSE)—This airspeed provides the most altitude\\ngain in a given period of time in a light, twin-\\nengine airplane following an engine failure.\\nInstrument Check— Prior to takeoff, the airspeed\\nindicator should read zero.

When beginning\\nthe takeoff, make sure the airspeed is increasing at an\\nappropriate rate. \\nBLOCKAGE OF THE PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM\\nErrors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube,\\nthe static port(s), or both. Blockage may be caused by\\nmoisture (including ice), dirt, or even insects. During pre-\\nflight, make sure the pitot tube cover is removed. Then,\\ncheck the pitot and static port openings. A blocked pitot\\ntube affects the accuracy of only the airspeed indicator.\\nHowever, a blockage of the static system not only affects\\nthe airspeed indicator, but can also cause errors in the\\naltimeter and vertical speed indicator.\\nBLOCKED PITOT SYSTEM \\nThe pitot system can become blocked completely or\\nonly partially if the pitot tube drain hole remains open.\\nIf the pitot tube becomes blocked and its associated\\ndrain hole remains clear, ram air no longer is able to\\nenter the pitot system. Air already in the system will\\nvent through the drain hole, and the remaining pressure\\nwill drop to ambient (outside) air pressure. Under these\\ncircumstances, the airspeed indicator reading decreases\\nto zero, because the airspeed indicator senses no \\ndifference between ram and static air pressure. The \\nairspeed indicator acts as if the airplane were stationary\\non the ramp. The apparent loss of airspeed is not \\nusually instantaneous. Instead, the airspeed will drop\\ntoward zero. [Figure 6-8]\\nIf the pitot tube, drain hole, and static system all\\nbecome blocked in flight, changes in airspeed will not\\nbe indicated, due to the trapped pressures. However, if\\nthe static system remains clear, the airspeed indicator\\nacts as an altimeter. An apparent increase in the ram air\\npressure relative to static pressure occurs as altitude\\nincreases above the level where the pitot tube and drain\\nhole became blocked. This pressure differential causes\\nthe airspeed indicator to show an increase in speed. A\\ndecrease in indicated airspeed occurs as the airplane\\ndescends below the altitude at which the pitot system\\nbecame blocked. [Figure 6-9]\\nThe pitot tube may become blocked during flight\\nthrough visible moisture.

The most common\\ninstruments containing gyroscopes are the turn \\ncoordinator, heading indicator, and the attitude \\nindicator. To understand how these instruments operate\\nrequires knowledge of the instrument power systems,\\ngyroscopic principles, and the operating principles of\\neach instrument.\\nGYROSCOPIC PRINCIPLES\\nAny spinning object exhibits gyroscopic properties. A\\nwheel or rotor designed and mounted to utilize these\\nproperties is called a gyroscope. Two important design\\ncharacteristics of an instrument gyro are great weight\\nfor its size, or high density, and rotation at high speed\\nwith low friction bearings. \\nThere are two general types of mountings; the type used\\ndepends upon which property of the gyro is utilized. A\\nfreely or universally mounted gyroscope is free to rotate\\nin any direction about its center of gravity. Such a wheel\\nis said to have three planes of freedom. The wheel or\\nrotor is free to rotate in any plane in relation to the base\\nand is so balanced that with the gyro wheel at rest, it will\\nremain in the position in which it is placed. Restricted or\\nsemirigidly mounted gyroscopes are those mounted so\\nthat one of the planes of freedom is held fixed in relation\\nto the base.\\nThere are two fundamental properties of gyroscopic\\naction—rigidity in space and precession.\\nRIGIDITY IN SPACE\\nRigidity in space refers to the principle that a gyro-\\nscope remains in a fixed position in the plane in which\\nit is spinning. By mounting this wheel, or gyroscope,\\non a set of gimbal rings, the gyro is able to rotate freely\\nin any direction. Thus, if the gimbal rings are tilted,\\ntwisted, or otherwise moved, the gyro remains in the\\nplane in which it was originally spinning. [Figure 6-11]\\nPRECESSION\\nPrecession is the tilting or turning of a gyro in response\\nto a deflective force. The reaction to this force does not\\noccur at the point where it was applied; rather, it occurs\\nat a point that is 90° later in the direction of rotation.\\nThis principle allows the gyro to determine a rate of\\nturn by sensing the amount of pressure created by \\na change in direction. The rate at which the gyro \\nprecesses is inversely proportional to the speed of the\\nrotor and proportional to the deflective force.\\nPitot Tube\\nInaccurate\\nAirspeed\\nIndications\\nConstant Zero\\nIndication on VSI\\nFrozen\\nAltimeter\\nStatic\\nPort\\nBlockage\\nFigure 6-10.

[Figure 6-12]\\nSOURCES OF POWER\\nIn some airplanes, all the gyros are vacuum, pressure,\\nor electrically operated; in others, vacuum or pressure\\nsystems provide the power for the heading and attitude\\nindicators, while the electrical system provides the\\npower for the turn coordinator. Most airplanes have at\\nleast two sources of power to ensure at least one source\\nof bank information if one power source fails.\\nThe vacuum or pressure system spins the gyro by \\ndrawing a stream of air against the rotor vanes to spin\\nthe rotor at high speed, much like the operation of a\\nwaterwheel or turbine. The amount of vacuum or \\npressure required for instrument operation varies, but is\\nusually between 4.5 and 5.5 in. Hg.\\nOne source of vacuum for the gyros is a vane-type\\nengine-driven pump that is mounted on the accessory\\ncase of the engine. Pump capacity varies in different\\nairplanes, depending on the number of gyros.\\nA typical vacuum system consists of an engine-driven\\nvacuum pump, relief valve, air filter, gauge, and tubing\\nnecessary to complete the connections. The gauge is\\nmounted in the airplane’s instrument panel and indi-\\ncates the amount of pressure in the system (vacuum is \\nmeasured in inches of mercury less than ambient \\npressure).\\nAs shown in figure 6-13, air is drawn into the vacuum\\nsystem by the engine-driven vacuum pump. It first goes\\nthrough a filter, which prevents foreign matter from\\nentering the vacuum or pressure system. The air then\\nmoves through the attitude and heading indicators,\\nwhere it causes the gyros to spin. A relief valve \\nprevents the vacuum pressure, or suction, from exceed-\\ning prescribed limits. After that, the air is expelled\\noverboard or used in other systems, such as for \\ninflating pneumatic deicing boots.\\nIt is important to monitor vacuum pressure during\\nflight, because the attitude and heading indicators may\\nnot provide reliable information when suction pressure\\nis low. The vacuum, or suction, gauge generally is\\nmarked to indicate the normal range. Some airplanes\\nare equipped with a warning light that illuminates when\\nthe vacuum pressure drops below the acceptable level.\\nTURN INDICATORS\\nAirplanes use two types of turn indicators—the turn-\\nand-slip indicator and the turn coordinator.

Coordination is achieved by referring to\\nthe inclinometer , which consists of a liquid-filled\\ncurved tube with a ball inside. [Figure 6-14]\\nTURN-AND-SLIP INDICATOR\\nThe gyro in the turn-and-slip indicator rotates in \\nthe vertical plane, corresponding to the airplane’s \\nlongitudinal axis. A single gimbal limits the planes in\\nwhich the gyro can tilt, and a spring tries to return it to\\ncenter. Because of precession, a yawing force causes\\nthe gyro to tilt left or right as viewed from the pilot seat.\\nThe turn-and-slip indicator uses a pointer, called the\\nturn needle, to show the direction and rate of turn.\\nTURN COORDINATOR\\nThe gimbal in the turn coordinator is canted; therefore,\\nits gyro can sense both rate of roll and rate of turn.\\nSince turn coordinators are more prevalent in training\\nairplanes, this discussion concentrates on that instru-\\nment. When rolling into or out of a turn, the miniature\\nairplane banks in the direction the airplane is rolled. A\\nrapid roll rate causes the miniature airplane to bank\\nmore steeply than a slow roll rate. \\nThe turn coordinator can be used to establish and \\nmaintain a standard-rate-turn by aligning the wing of\\nthe miniature airplane with the turn index. The turn\\ncoordinator indicates only the rate and direction of\\nturn; it does not display a specific angle of bank. \\nINCLINOMETER\\nThe inclinometer is used to depict airplane yaw, which\\nis the side-to-side movement of the airplane’s nose.\\nDuring coordinated, straight-and-level flight, the force\\nof gravity causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the\\ntube, centered between the reference lines. Coordinated\\nflight is maintained by keeping the ball centered. If the\\nball is not centered, it can be centered by using the rud-\\nder. To do this, apply rudder pressure on the side where\\nthe ball is deflected. Use the simple rule, “step on the\\nball,” to remember which rudder pedal to press. \\nIf aileron and rudder are coordinated during a turn, the\\nball remains centered in the tube. If aerodynamic forces\\nare unbalanced, the ball moves away from the center of\\nthe tube.

A complete 360° turn\\ntakes 2 minutes. A rule of thumb for determining the approximate bank\\nangle required for a standard-rate turn is to divide the true airspeed by\\n10 and add one-half the result. For example, at 120 knots, approximately\\n18° of bank is required (120 �10 = 12 + 6 = 18). At 200 knots, it would\\ntake approximately 30° of bank for a standard-rate-turn. \\nInclinometer—An instrument consisting of a curved glass tube, housing\\na glass ball, and damped with a fluid similar to kerosene.

In a skid, the rate of\\nturn is too great for the angle of bank, and the ball\\nmoves to the outside of the turn. To correct for these\\nconditions, and improve the quality of the turn, remem-\\nber to “step on the ball.” Varying the angle of bank can\\nalso help restore coordinated flight from a slip or skid.\\nTo correct for a slip, decrease bank and/or increase the\\nrate of turn. To correct for a skid, increase the bank\\nand/or decrease the rate of turn.\\nInstrument Check— During the preflight, check to\\nsee that the inclinometer is full of fluid and has no air\\nbubbles. The ball should also be resting at its lowest\\npoint. When taxiing, the turn coordinator should indi-\\ncate a turn in the correct direction. \\nTHE ATTITUDE INDICATOR\\nThe attitude indicator, with its miniature airplane and\\nhorizon bar, displays a picture of the attitude of the air-\\nplane. The relationship of the miniature airplane to the\\nhorizon bar is the same as the relationship of the real\\nairplane to the actual horizon. The instrument gives an\\ninstantaneous indication of even the smallest changes\\nin attitude. \\nThe gyro in the attitude indicator is mounted on a hori-\\nzontal plane and depends upon rigidity in space for its\\noperation. The horizon bar represents the true horizon.\\nThis bar is fixed to the gyro and remains in a horizontal\\nplane as the airplane is pitched or banked about its \\nlateral or longitudinal axis, indicating the attitude of\\nthe airplane relative to the true horizon. [Figure 6-16]\\nAn adjustment knob is provided with which the pilot\\nmay move the miniature airplane up or down to align\\nthe miniature airplane with the horizon bar to suit the\\npilot’s line of vision. Normally, the miniature airplane\\nis adjusted so that the wings overlap the horizon bar\\nwhen the airplane is in straight-and-level cruising\\nflight.\\nThe pitch and bank limits depend upon the make and\\nmodel of the instrument. Limits in the banking plane\\nare usually from 100° to 110°, and the pitch limits are\\nusually from 60° to 70°. If either limit is exceeded, the\\ninstrument will tumble or spill and will give incorrect\\nindications until restabilized. A number of modern \\nattitude indicators will not tumble.\\nEvery pilot should be able to interpret the banking scale\\nillustrated in figure 6-17. Most banking scale indicators\\non the top of the instrument move in the same direction\\nfrom that in which the airplane is actually banked.\\nSome other models move in the opposite direction from\\nthat in which the airplane is actually banked. This may\\nconfuse the pilot if the indicator is used to determine\\nthe direction of bank. This scale should be used only to\\ncontrol the degree of desired bank. The relationship of\\nthe miniature airplane to the horizon bar should be used\\nfor an indication of the direction of bank.\\nThe attitude indicator is reliable and the most realistic\\nflight instrument on the instrument panel. Its indica-\\ntions are very close approximations of the actual \\nattitude of the airplane.\\nHEADING INDICATOR\\nThe heading indicator (or directional gyro) is funda-\\nmentally a mechanical instrument designed to facilitate\\nthe use of the magnetic compass. Errors in the \\nmagnetic compass are numerous, making straight flight\\nand precision turns to headings difficult to accomplish,\\nparticularly in turbulent air. A heading indicator, \\nhowever, is not affected by the forces that make the\\nmagnetic compass difficult to interpret.

The rotor turns in a\\nvertical plane, and fixed to the rotor is a compass card.\\nSince the rotor remains rigid in space, the points on the\\ncard hold the same position in space relative to the ver-\\ntical plane. As the instrument case and the airplane\\nrevolve around the vertical axis, the card provides clear\\nand accurate heading information.\\nBecause of precession, caused by friction, the heading\\nindicator will creep or drift from a heading to which it\\nis set. Among other factors, the amount of drift depends\\nlargely upon the condition of the instrument. If the\\nbearings are worn, dirty, or improperly lubricated, the\\ndrift may be excessive. Another error in the heading\\nindicator is caused by the fact that the gyro is oriented\\nin space, and the earth rotates in space at a rate of 15°\\nin 1 hour. Thus, discounting precession caused by fric-\\ntion, the heading indicator may indicate as much as 15°\\nerror per every hour of operation.\\nSome heading indicators receive a magnetic north refer-\\nence from a magnetic slaving transmitter, and generally\\nneed no adjustment. Heading indicators that do not have\\nthis automatic north-seeking capability are called “free”\\ngyros, and require periodic adjustment. It is important\\nto check the indications frequently (approximately\\nevery 15 minutes) and reset the heading indicator to\\nalign it with the magnetic compass when required.\\nAdjust the heading indicator to the magnetic compass\\nheading when the airplane is straight and level at a con-\\nstant speed to avoid compass errors.\\nThe bank and pitch limits of the heading indicator vary\\nwith the particular design and make of instrument. On\\nsome heading indicators found in light airplanes, the\\nlimits are approximately 55° of pitch and 55° of bank.\\nWhen either of these attitude limits is exceeded, the\\ninstrument “tumbles” or “spills” and no longer gives\\nthe correct indication until reset. After spilling, it may\\nbe reset with the caging knob. Many of the modern\\ninstruments used are designed in such a manner that\\nthey will not tumble.\\nInstrument Check— As the gyro spools up, make sure\\nthere are no abnormal sounds. While taxiing, the instrument\\nshould indicate turns in the correct direction, and \\nprecession should not be abnormal. At idle power \\nsettings, the gyroscopic instruments using the vacuum\\nsystem might not be up to operating speeds and preces-\\nsion might occur more rapidly than during flight. \\nMAGNETIC COMPASS\\nSince the magnetic compass works on the principle of\\nmagnetism, it is well for the pilot to have at least a basic\\nunderstanding of magnetism. A simple bar magnet has\\ntwo centers of magnetism which are called poles. Lines\\nof magnetic force flow out from each pole in all direc-\\ntions, eventually bending around and returning to the\\nother pole. The area through which these lines of force\\nflow is called the field of the magnet. For the purpose\\nof this discussion, the poles are designated “north” and\\n“south.” If two bar magnets are placed near each other,\\nthe north pole of one will attract the south pole of the\\nother. There is evidence that there is a magnetic field\\nsurrounding the Earth, and this theory is applied in the\\ndesign of the magnetic compass. It acts very much as\\nthough there were a huge bar magnet running along the\\naxis of the Earth which ends several hundred miles\\nbelow the surface. [Figure 6-19]\\nThe geographic north and south poles form the axis for\\nthe Earth’s rotation. These positions are also referred to\\nas true north and south. Another axis is formed by the\\nmagnetic north and south poles. Lines of magnetic\\nforce flow out from each pole in all directions, and\\neventually return to the opposite pole. A compass\\naligns itself with the magnetic axis formed by the\\nnorth/south magnetic field of the Earth. \\nThe lines of force have a vertical component (or pull)\\nwhich is zero at the Equator, but builds to 100 percent of\\nthe total force at the magnetic poles. If magnetic needles,\\nsuch as in the airplane’s magnetic compass, are held\\nalong these lines of force, the vertical component\\nN\\nS\\nN\\nS\\nNorth Magnetic Pole Geographic North Pole\\nThe Earth's magnetic field compared\\nto a bar magnet.\\nMagnetic field around a\\nbar magnet.\\nFigure 6-19.

The amount of dip increases as the needles\\nare moved closer and closer to the poles. It is this\\ndeflection, or dip, that causes some of the larger \\ncompass errors.\\nThe magnetic compass, which is usually the only \\ndirection-seeking instrument in the airplane, is simple\\nin construction. It contains two steel magnetized \\nneedles fastened to a float, around which is mounted a\\ncompass card. The needles are parallel, with their\\nnorth-seeking ends pointing in the same direction. The\\ncompass card has letters for cardinal headings, and\\neach 30° interval is represented by a number, the last\\nzero of which is omitted. For example, 30° appears as a\\n3 and 300° appears as a 30. Between these numbers,\\nthe card is graduated for each 5°. The magnetic \\ncompass is required equipment in all airplanes. It is\\nused to set the gyroscopic heading indicator, correct for\\nprecession, and as a backup in the event the heading\\nindicator(s) fails. [Figure 6-20]\\nCOMPASS ERRORS\\nVARIATION\\nAlthough the magnetic field of the Earth lies roughly\\nnorth and south, the Earth’s magnetic poles do not \\ncoincide with its geographic poles, which are used in\\nthe construction of aeronautical charts. Consequently,\\nat most places on the Earth’s surface, the direction-\\nsensitive steel needles that seek the Earth’s magnetic\\nfield will not point to true north, but to magnetic north.\\nFurthermore, local magnetic fields from mineral\\ndeposits and other conditions may distort the Earth’s\\nmagnetic field, and cause additional error in the \\nposition of the compass’ north-seeking magnetized\\nneedles with reference to true north. \\nThe angular difference between magnetic north, the\\nreference for the magnetic compass, and true north is\\nvariation. Lines that connect points of equal variation\\nare called isogonic lines. The line connecting points\\nwhere the magnetic variation is zero is an agonic line.\\nTo convert from true courses or headings to magnetic,\\nsubtract easterly variation and add westerly variation.\\nReverse the process to convert from magnetic to true.\\n[Figure 6-21]\\nInstrument\\nLamp\\nFloat Expansion Unit\\nOuter\\nCase\\nFiller Hole\\nCompensating\\nMagnetCompass Card\\nLubber Line\\nCompensating\\nScrews\\nSensing\\nMagnet\\nLens\\nCard\\nLubber Line\\nFigure 6-20.

These magnetic\\nfields distort the Earth’s magnetic force, and cause\\nthe compass to swing away from the correct heading.\\nThis error is called deviation. Manufacturers install\\ncompensating magnets within the compass housing\\nto reduce the effects of deviation. The magnets are\\nusually adjusted while the engine is running and all\\nelectrical equipment is operating. However, it is not\\npossible to completely eliminate deviation error;\\ntherefore, a compass correction card is mounted near\\nthe compass. This card corrects for deviation that\\noccurs from one heading to the next as the lines of\\nforce interact at different angles. [Figure 6-22]\\nMAGNETIC DIP\\nMagnetic dip is the result of the vertical component of\\nthe Earth’s magnetic field. This dip is virtually \\nnon-existent at the magnetic equator, since the lines of\\nforce are parallel to the Earth’s surface and the vertical\\ncomponent is minimal. When a compass is moved\\ntoward the poles, the vertical component increases, and \\nmagnetic dip becomes more apparent at higher \\nlatitudes. Magnetic dip is responsible for compass\\nerrors during acceleration, deceleration, and turns. \\nUSING THE MAGNETIC COMPASS\\nACCELERATION/DECELERATION ERRORS\\nAcceleration and deceleration errors are fluctuations in\\nthe compass during changes in speed. In the Northern\\nHemisphere, the compass swings towards the north\\nduring acceleration, and towards the south during\\ndeceleration. When the speed stabilizes, the compass\\nreturns to an accurate indication. This error is most \\npronounced when flying on a heading of east or west,\\nand decreases gradually when flying closer to a north\\nor south heading. The error does not occur when flying\\ndirectly north or south. The memory aid, ANDS\\n(Accelerate North, Decelerate South) may help in\\nrecalling this error. In the Southern Hemisphere, this\\nerror occurs in the opposite direction. \\nTURNING ERRORS\\nTurning errors are most apparent when turning to or\\nfrom a heading of north or south. This error increases\\nas the poles are neared and magnetic dip becomes more\\napparent. There is no turning error when flying near the\\nmagnetic equator. \\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, when making a turn from\\na northerly heading, the compass gives an initial \\nindication of a turn in the opposite direction. It then\\nbegins to show the turn in the proper direction, but lags\\nbehind the actual heading. The amount of lag decreases\\nas the turn continues, then disappears as the airplane\\nreaches a heading of east or west. When turning from a\\nheading of east or west to a heading of north, there is\\nno error as the turn begins. However, as the heading\\napproaches north, the compass increasingly lags behind\\nthe airplane’s actual heading. When making a turn from\\na southerly heading, the compass gives an indication\\nof a turn in the correct direction, but leads the actual\\nheading. This error also disappears as the airplane\\napproaches an east or west heading. Turning from east\\nor west to a heading of south causes the compass to\\nmove correctly at the start of a turn, but then it increas-\\ningly leads the actual heading as the airplane nears a\\nsoutherly direction.\\nThe amount of lead or lag is approximately equal to\\nthe latitude of the airplane. For example, if turning\\nfrom a heading of south to a heading of west while\\nflying at 40° north latitude, the compass rapidly turns\\nto a heading of 220° (180° + 40°). At the midpoint of\\nthe turn, the lead decreases to approximately half\\n(20°), and upon reaching a heading of west, it is zero. \\nThe magnetic compass, which is the only direction-seek-\\ning instrument in the airplane, should be read only when\\nthe airplane is flying straight and level at a constant speed.\\nThis will help reduce errors to a minimum. \\nIf the pilot thoroughly understands the errors and charac-\\nteristics of the magnetic compass, this instrument can\\nbecome the most reliable means of determining headings.\\nFOR (MH)\\nSTEER (CH)\\n0° 30° 60° 90° 120° 150° 180° 210° 240° 270° 300° 330°\\n359° 30° 60° 88° 120° 152° 183° 212° 240° 268° 300° 329°\\nRADIO ON RADIO OFF✓\\nFigure 6-22.

Therefore, manufacturers are\\nrequired to include the serial number and registration\\non the title page to identify the airplane to which the\\nmanual belongs. If a manual does not indicate a spe-\\ncific airplane registration and serial number, it is\\nlimited to general study purposes only.\\nMost manufacturers include a table of contents, which\\nidentifies the order of the entire manual by section\\nFigure 7-1.

Page numbers reflect the section\\nand page within that section (1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1, and so\\nforth). If the manual is published in loose-leaf form,\\neach section is usually marked with a divider tab indi-\\ncating the section number or title, or both. The\\nEmergency Procedures section may have a red tab for\\nquick identification and reference.\\nGENERAL (SECTION 1)\\nThe General section provides the basic descriptive\\ninformation on the airplane and powerplant(s). Some\\nmanuals include a three-view drawing of the airplane\\nthat provides dimensions of various components.\\nIncluded are such items as wingspan, maximum height,\\noverall length, wheelbase length, main landing gear\\ntrack width, maximum propeller diameter, propeller\\nground clearance, minimum turning radius, and wing\\narea. This section serves as a quick reference in becom-\\ning familiar with the airplane.\\nThe last segment of the General section contains defi-\\nnitions, abbreviations, explanations of symbology, and\\nsome of the terminology used in the POH. At the option\\nof the manufacturer, metric and other conversion tables\\nmay also be included.\\nLIMITATIONS (SECTION 2)\\nThe Limitations section contains only those limitations\\nrequired by regulation or that are necessary for the safe\\noperation of the airplane, powerplant, systems, and\\nequipment. It includes operating limitations, instru-\\nment markings, color-coding, and basic placards. Some\\nof the limitation areas are: airspeed, powerplant, weight\\nand loading distribution, and flight.\\nAIRSPEED\\nAirspeed limitations are shown on the airspeed indicator\\nby color-coding and on placards or graphs in the air-\\nplane. [Figure 7-2] A red line on the airspeed indicator\\nshows the airspeed limit beyond which structural damage\\ncould occur. This is called the never-exceed speed\\n(V\\nNE). A yellow arc indicates the speed range between\\nmaximum structural cruising speed (V NO) and V NE.\\nOperation of the airplane in the yellow airspeed arc is\\nfor smooth air only, and then with caution. A green arc\\ndepicts the normal operating speed range, with the\\nupper end at V\\nNO, and the lower end at stalling speed at\\nmaximum weight with the landing gear and flaps\\nretracted (V\\nS1). The flap operating range is depicted by\\nthe white arc, with the upper end at the maximum flap\\nextended speed (V\\nFE), and the lower end at the stalling\\nspeed with the landing gear and flaps in the landing\\nconfiguration (V\\nSO).\\nIn addition to the markings listed above, small multi-\\nengine airplanes will have a red radial line to indicate\\nsingle-engine minimum controllable airspeed (V\\nMC). A\\nblue radial line is used to indicate single-engine best\\nrate-of-climb speed at maximum weight at sea level\\n(V\\nYSE).\\nPOWERPLANT\\nThe Powerplant Limitations area describes operating\\nlimitations on the airplane’s reciprocating or turbine\\nengine(s). These include limitations for takeoff power,\\nmaximum continuous power, and maximum normal\\noperating power, which is the maximum power the\\nengine can produce without any restrictions, and is\\ndepicted by a green arc. Other items that can be\\nincluded in this area are the minimum and maximum\\noil and fuel pressures, oil and fuel grades, and propeller\\noperating limits. [Figure 7-3]\\nFigure 7-3. Minimum, maximum, and normal operating range\\nmarkings on oil gauge.\\nAll reciprocating-engine powered airplanes must have\\nan r.p.m. indicator for each engine. Airplanes equipped\\nwith a constant-speed propeller use a manifold pres-\\nsure gauge to monitor power output and an r.p.m. gauge\\nto monitor propeller speed. Both instruments depict the\\nmaximum operating limit with a red radial line and the\\nnormal operating range with a green arc. Some instru-\\nments may have a yellow arc to indicate a caution area.\\n[Figure 7-4]\\nWEIGHT AND LOADING DISTRIBUTION\\nThe Weight and Loading Distribution area contains the\\nmaximum certificated weights, as well as the center-of-\\ngravity (CG) range. The location of the reference\\ndatum used in balance computations is included in this\\nFigure 7-2.

It also indicates those maneuvers that\\nare prohibited, such as spins, acrobatic flight, and\\noperational limitations such as flight into known icing\\nconditions.\\nPLACARDS\\nMost airplanes display one or more placards that con-\\ntain information having a direct bearing on the safe\\noperation of the airplane. These placards are located\\nin conspicuous places within the airplane and are\\nreproduced in the Limitations section or as directed\\nby an Airworthiness Directive (AD). [Figure 7-5]\\nFigure 7-5. Placards are a common method of depicting air-\\nplane limitations.\\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURES (SECTION 3)\\nChecklists describing the recommended procedures\\nand airspeeds for coping with various types of\\nemergencies or critical situations are located in the\\nEmergency Procedures section. Some of the emergen-\\ncies covered include: engine failure, fires, and systems\\nfailures. The procedures for in-flight engine restarting\\nand ditching may also be included.\\nManufacturers may first show the emergencies check-\\nlists in an abbreviated form with the order of items\\nreflecting the sequence of action. Amplified checklists\\nthat provide additional information on the procedures\\nfollow the abbreviated checklist. To be prepared for\\nemergency situations, memorize the immediate action\\nitems and after completion, refer to the appropriate\\nchecklist.\\nManufacturers may include an optional area titled\\n“Abnormal Procedures.” This section describes recom-\\nmended procedures for handling malfunctions that are\\nnot considered emergencies in nature.\\nNORMAL PROCEDURES (SECTION 4)\\nThis section begins with a listing of the airspeeds for\\nnormal operations. The next area consists of several\\nchecklists that may include preflight inspection, before\\nstarting procedures, starting engine, before taxiing,\\ntaxiing, before takeoff, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent,\\nbefore landing, balked landing, after landing, and post-\\nflight procedures. An Amplified Procedures area\\nfollows the checklists to provide more detailed\\ninformation about the various procedures.\\nTo avoid missing important steps, always use the\\nappropriate checklists whenever they are available.\\nConsistent adherence to approved checklists is a sign\\nof a disciplined and competent pilot.\\nPERFORMANCE (SECTION 5)\\nThe Performance section contains all the information\\nrequired by the aircraft certification regulations, and\\nany additional performance information the manufac-\\nturer feels may enhance a pilot’s ability to safely operate\\nthe airplane. Performance charts, tables, and graphs vary\\nin style, but all contain the same basic information. Some\\nexamples of the performance information found in most\\nflight manuals include a graph or table for converting\\ncalibrated airspeed into true airspeed; stall speeds in\\nvarious configurations; and data for determining takeoff\\nand climb performance, cruise performance, and landing\\nperformance. Figure 7-6 is an example of a typical\\nperformance graph. For more information on how to\\nuse the charts, graphs, and tables, refer to Chapter 9—\\nAircraft Performance.\\nWEIGHT AND BALANCE/EQUIPMENT LIST\\n(SECTION 6)\\nThe Weight and Balance/Equipment List section\\ncontains all the information required by the FAA to\\ncalculate the weight and balance of the airplane.\\nFigure 7-4.

Flight\\nsafety relies, in part, on the condition of the aircraft,\\nwhich is determined by inspections performed by\\nmechanics, approved repair stations, or manufacturers\\nwho meet specific requirements of 14 CFR part 43.\\nA Special Airworthiness Certificate is issued for all\\naircraft certificated in other than the Standard classi-\\nfications, such as Experimental, Restricted, Limited,\\nProvisional, and Sport Pilot. When purchasing an aircraft\\nclassified as other than Standard, it is recommended that\\nthe local FSDO be contacted for an explanation of the\\npertinent airworthiness requirements and the limitations\\nof such a certificate.\\nAIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE\\nMaintenance is defined as the preservation, inspection,\\noverhaul, and repair of an aircraft, including the\\nreplacement of parts. A PROPERLY MAINTAINED\\nAIRCRAFT IS A SAFE AIRCRAFT. In addition, reg-\\nular and proper maintenance ensures that an aircraft\\nmeets an acceptable standard of airworthiness through-\\nout its operational life.\\nAlthough maintenance requirements vary for different\\ntypes of aircraft, experience shows that aircraft need\\nsome type of preventive maintenance every 25 hours of\\nflying time or less, and minor maintenance at least every\\n100 hours. This is influenced by the kind of operation,\\nclimatic conditions, storage facilities, age, and construc-\\ntion of the aircraft. Manufacturers supply maintenance\\nmanuals, parts catalogs, and other service information\\nthat should be used in maintaining the aircraft.\\nAIRCRAFT INSPECTIONS\\n14 CFR part 91 places primary responsibility on the\\nowner or operator for maintaining an aircraft in an\\nairworthy condition. Certain inspections must be per-\\nformed on the aircraft, and the owner must maintain\\nthe airworthiness of the aircraft during the time\\nbetween required inspections by having any defects\\ncorrected.\\n14 CFR part 91, subpart E, requires the inspection of\\nall civil aircraft at specific intervals to determine the\\noverall condition. The interval depends upon the\\ntype of operations in which the aircraft is engaged.\\nSome aircraft need to be inspected at least once each\\n12-calendar months, while inspection is required for\\nothers after each 100 hours of operation. In some\\ninstances, an aircraft may be inspected in accordance\\nwith an inspection system set up to provide for total\\ninspection of the aircraft on the basis of calendar time,\\ntime in service, number of system operations, or any\\ncombination of these.\\nAll inspections should follow the current manufac-\\nturer’s maintenance manual, including the Instructions\\nfor Continued Airworthiness concerning inspections\\nintervals, parts replacement, and life-limited items as\\napplicable to the aircraft.\\nANNUAL INSPECTION\\nAny reciprocating-engine powered or single-engine-\\nturbojet/turbo-propeller powered small aircraft (12,500\\npounds and under) flown for business or pleasure and\\nnot flown for compensation or hire is required to be\\ninspected at least annually. The inspection shall be\\nperformed by a certificated airframe and powerplant\\n(A&P) mechanic who holds an Inspection Authorization\\n(IA), by the manufacturer, or by a certificated and appro-\\npriately rated repair station. The aircraft may not\\nbe operated unless the annual inspection has been\\nperformed within the preceding 12-calendar months. A\\nperiod of 12-calendar months extends from any day of\\na month to the last day of the same month the following\\nyear. An aircraft overdue for an annual inspection may\\nbe operated under a Special Flight Permit issued by the\\nFAA for the purpose of flying the aircraft to a location\\nwhere the annual inspection can be performed.\\nHowever, all applicable Airworthiness Directives that\\nare due must be complied with.\\n100-HOUR INSPECTION\\nAll aircraft under 12,500 pounds (except turbojet/turbo-\\npropeller powered multiengine airplanes and turbine\\npowered rotorcraft), used to carry passengers for hire,\\nmust have received a 100-hour inspection within the\\npreceding 100 hours of time in service and have been\\napproved for return to service. Additionally, an aircraft\\nused for flight instruction for hire, when provided by\\nthe person giving the flight instruction, must also have\\nreceived a 100-hour inspection. This inspection must\\nbe performed by an FAA certificated A&P mechanic,\\nan appropriately rated FAA certificated repair station,\\nCh 07.qxd  10/24/03  7:04 AM  Page 7-7'),\n",

An annual inspection,\\nor an inspection for the issuance of an Airworthiness\\nCertificate may be substituted for a required 100-hour\\ninspection. The 100-hour limitation may be exceeded\\nby not more than 10 hours while en route to reach a\\nplace where the inspection can be done. The excess\\ntime used to reach a place where the inspection can be\\ndone must be included in computing the next 100 hours\\nof time in service.\\nOTHER INSPECTION PROGRAMS\\nThe annual and 100-hour inspection requirements do\\nnot apply to large (over 12,500 pounds) airplanes,\\nturbojets, or turbo-propeller powered multiengine\\nairplanes or to aircraft for which the owner complies\\nwith a progressive inspection program. Details of these\\nrequirements may be determined by reference to 14\\nCFR part 43, section 43.11 and part 91, subpart E, and\\nby inquiring at a local FSDO.\\nALTIMETER SYSTEM INSPECTION\\n14 CFR part 91, section 91.411 requires that the altime-\\nter, encoding altimeter, and related system be tested\\nand inspected in the preceding 24 months before\\noperated in controlled airspace under instrument\\nflight rules (IFR).\\nTRANSPONDER INSPECTION\\n14 CFR part 91, section 91.413 requires that before a\\ntransponder can be used under 14 CFR part 91, section\\n91.215(a), it shall be tested and inspected within the\\npreceding 24 months.\\nPREFLIGHT INSPECTIONS\\nThe preflight inspection is a thorough and systematic\\nmeans by which a pilot determines if the aircraft is air-\\nworthy and in condition for safe operation. POHs and\\nowner/information manuals contain a section devoted\\nto a systematic method of performing a preflight\\ninspection.\\nMINIMUM EQUIPMENT LISTS (MEL) AND \\nOPERATIONS WITH INOPERATIVE EQUIPMENT\\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) requires that\\nall aircraft instruments and installed equipment are\\noperative prior to each departure. When the FAA\\nadopted the minimum equipment list (MEL) con-\\ncept for 14 CFR part 91 operations, this allowed for\\nthe first time, operations with inoperative items deter-\\nmined to be nonessential for safe flight. At the same\\ntime, it allowed part 91 operators, without an MEL, to\\ndefer repairs on nonessential equipment within the\\nguidelines of part 91.\\nThere are two primary methods of deferring main-\\ntenance on small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered\\nairplanes, gliders, or lighter-than-air aircraft operated\\nunder part 91. They are the deferral provision of 14\\nCFR part 91, section 91.213(d) and an FAA-approved\\nMEL.\\nThe deferral provision of section 91.213(d) is widely\\nused by most pilot/operators. Its popularity is due to\\nsimplicity and minimal paperwork. When inoperative\\nequipment is found during preflight or prior to depar-\\nture, the decision should be to cancel the flight, obtain\\nmaintenance prior to flight, or to defer the item or\\nequipment.\\nMaintenance deferrals are not used for in-flight dis-\\ncrepancies. The manufacturer’s AFM/POH procedures\\nare to be used in those situations. The discussion that\\nfollows assumes that the pilot wishes to defer mainte-\\nnance that would ordinarily be required prior to flight.\\nUsing the deferral provision of section 91.213(d), the\\npilot determines whether the inoperative equipment is\\nrequired by type design, the CFRs, or ADs. If the\\ninoperative item is not required, and the aircraft can\\nbe safely operated without it, the deferral may be made.\\nThe inoperative item shall be deactivated or removed\\nand an INOPERATIVE placard placed near the appro-\\npriate switch, control, or indicator. If deactivation or\\nremoval involves maintenance (removal always will),\\nit must be accomplished by certificated maintenance\\npersonnel.\\nFor example, if the position lights (installed equipment)\\nwere discovered to be inoperative prior to a daytime\\nflight, the pilot would follow the requirements of\\nsection 91.213(d).\\nThe deactivation may be a process as simple as the pilot\\npositioning a circuit breaker to the OFF position, or as\\ncomplex as rendering instruments or equipment totally\\ninoperable. Complex maintenance tasks require a cer-\\ntificated and appropriately rated maintenance person to\\nperform the deactivation. In all cases, the item or\\nequipment must be placarded INOPERATIVE.\\nMinimum Equipment List (MEL)—An inventory of instruments and\\nequipment that may legally be inoperative, with the specific conditions\\nunder which an aircraft may be flown with such items inoperative.\\nCh 07.qxd  10/24/03  7:04 AM  Page 7-8'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='7-9\\nAll small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered airplanes,\\ngliders, or lighter-than-air aircraft operated under part\\n91 are eligible to use the maintenance deferral provi-\\nsions of section 91.213(d). However, once an operator\\nrequests an MEL, and a Letter of Authorization (LOA)\\nis issued by the FAA, then the use of the MEL becomes\\nmandatory for that aircraft. All maintenance deferrals\\nmust be accomplished in accordance with the terms\\nand conditions of the MEL and the operator-generated\\nprocedures document.\\nThe use of an MEL for an aircraft operated under part\\n91 also allows for the deferral of inoperative items or\\nequipment. The primary guidance becomes the FAA-\\napproved MEL issued to that specific operator and\\nN-numbered aircraft.\\nThe FAA has developed master minimum equipment\\nlists (MMELs) for aircraft in current use. Upon written\\nrequest by an operator, the local FSDO may issue the\\nappropriate make and model MMEL, along with an\\nLOA, and the preamble. The operator then develops\\noperations and maintenance (O&M) procedures from\\nthe MMEL. This MMEL with O&M procedures now\\nbecomes the operator’s MEL. The MEL, LOA, pream-\\nble, and procedures document developed by the operator\\nmust be on board the aircraft when it is operated.\\nThe FAA considers an approved MEL to be a supple-\\nmental type certificate (STC) issued to an aircraft by\\nserial number and registration number. It therefore\\nbecomes the authority to operate that aircraft in a\\ncondition other than originally type certificated.\\nWith an approved MEL, if the position lights were\\ndiscovered inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the\\npilot would make an entry in the maintenance record\\nor discrepancy record provided for that purpose. The\\nitem is then either repaired or deferred in accordance\\nwith the MEL. Upon confirming that daytime flight\\nwith inoperative position lights is acceptable in\\naccordance with the provisions of the MEL, the pilot\\nwould leave the position lights switch OFF, open the\\ncircuit breaker (or whatever action is called for in the\\nprocedures document), and placard the position light\\nswitch as INOPERATIVE.\\nThere are exceptions to the use of the MEL for deferral.\\nFor example, should a component fail that is not listed\\nin the MEL as deferrable (the tachometer, flaps, or stall\\nwarning device, for example), then repairs are required\\nto be performed prior to departure. If maintenance or\\nparts are not readily available at that location, a special\\nflight permit can be obtained from the nearest FSDO.\\nThis permit allows the aircraft to be flown to another\\nlocation for maintenance. This allows an aircraft that\\nmay not currently meet applicable airworthiness\\nrequirements, but is capable of safe flight, to be\\noperated under the restrictive special terms and con-\\nditions attached to the special flight permit.\\nDeferral of maintenance is not to be taken lightly, and\\ndue consideration should be given to the effect an\\ninoperative component may have on the operation of\\nan aircraft, particularly if other items are inoperative.\\nFurther information regarding MELs and operations\\nwith inoperative equipment can be found in Advisory\\nCircular (AC) 91-67, Minimum Equipment Requirements\\nfor General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91.\\nPREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE\\nPreventive maintenance is considered to be simple or\\nminor preservation operations and the replacement of\\nsmall standard parts, not involving complex assembly\\noperations. Certificated pilots, excluding student pilots,\\nsport pilots, and recreational pilots, may perform\\npreventive maintenance on any aircraft that is owned\\nor operated by them provided that aircraft is not used\\nin air carrier service. (Sport pilots operating light\\nsport aircraft, refer to 14 CFR part 65 for maintenance\\nprivileges.) 14 CFR part 43, Appendix A, contains a list\\nof the operations that are considered to be preventive\\nmaintenance.\\nREPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS\\nRepairs and alterations are classified as either major or\\nminor. 14 CFR part 43, Appendix A, describes the\\nalterations and repairs considered major. Major repairs\\nor alterations shall be approved for return to service on\\nFAA Form 337, Major Repairs and Major Alterations,\\nby an appropriately rated certificated repair station, an\\nFAA certificated A&P mechanic holding an Inspection\\nAuthorization, or a representative of the Administrator.\\nMinor repairs and minor alterations may be approved\\nfor return to service with a proper entry in the mainte-\\nnance records by an FAA certificated A&P mechanic or\\nan appropriately certificated repair station.\\nFor modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the\\noperating limitations issued to that aircraft.\\nModifications in accordance with FAA Order 8130.2,\\nAirworthiness Certification of Aircraft and Related\\nProducts, may require the notification of the issuing\\nauthority.\\nSPECIAL FLIGHT PERMITS\\nA special flight permit is a Special Airworthiness\\nCertificate issued authorizing operation of an aircraft\\nthat does not currently meet applicable airworthiness\\nrequirements but is safe for a specific flight. Before the\\npermit is issued, an FAA inspector may personally\\ninspect the aircraft, or require it to be inspected by an\\nFAA certificated A&P mechanic or an appropriately\\ncertificated repair station, to determine its safety for the\\nintended flight.

Operating an airplane\\nabove the maximum weight limitation compromises\\nthe structural integrity of the airplane and adversely\\naffects its performance. Operation with the center of\\ngravity (CG) outside the approved limits may result in\\ncontrol difficulty.\\nWEIGHT CONTROL\\nWeight is the force with which gravity attracts a body\\ntoward the center of the earth. It is a product of the\\nmass of a body and the acceleration acting on the body.\\nWeight is a major factor in airplane construction and\\noperation, and demands respect from all pilots.\\nThe force of gravity continually attempts to pull the air-\\nplane down toward earth. The force of lift is the only\\nforce that counteracts weight and sustains the airplane\\nin flight. However, the amount of lift produced by an\\nairfoil is limited by the airfoil design, angle of attack,\\nairspeed, and air density. Therefore, to assure that the\\nlift generated is sufficient to counteract weight, loading\\nthe airplane beyond the manufacturer’s recommended\\nweight must be avoided. If the weight is greater than\\nthe lift generated, the airplane may be incapable of\\nflight.\\nEFFECTS OF WEIGHT\\nAny item aboard the airplane that increases the total\\nweight is undesirable as far as performance is con-\\ncerned. Manufacturers attempt to make the airplane as\\nlight as possible without sacrificing strength or safety.\\nThe pilot of an airplane should always be aware of the\\nconsequences of overloading. An overloaded airplane\\nmay not be able to leave the ground, or if it does\\nbecome airborne, it may exhibit unexpected and\\nunusually poor flight characteristics. If an airplane is\\nnot properly loaded, the initial indication of poor per-\\nformance usually takes place during takeoff.\\nExcessive weight reduces the flight performance of an\\nairplane in almost every respect. The most important\\nperformance deficiencies of the overloaded airplane\\nare:\\n• Higher takeoff speed.\\n• Longer takeoff run.\\n• Reduced rate and angle of climb.\\n• Lower maximum altitude.\\n• Shorter range.\\n• Reduced cruising speed.\\n• Reduced maneuverability.\\n• Higher stalling speed.\\n• Higher approach and landing speed.\\n• Longer landing roll.\\n• Excessive weight on the nosewheel or tailwheel.\\nThe pilot must be knowledgeable in the effect of weight\\non the performance of the particular airplane being\\nflown. Preflight planning should include a check of\\nperformance charts to determine if the airplane’s\\nweight may contribute to hazardous flight operations.\\nExcessive weight in itself reduces the safety margins\\navailable to the pilot, and becomes even more hazardous\\nwhen other performance-reducing factors are combined\\nwith overweight. The pilot must also consider the con-\\nsequences of an overweight airplane if an emergency\\nCH 08.qxd  10/24/03  7:07 AM  Page 8-1'),\n",

If an engine fails on takeoff or air-\\nframe ice forms at low altitude, it is usually too late to\\nreduce the airplane’s weight to keep it in the air.\\nWEIGHT CHANGES\\nThe weight of the airplane can be changed by altering\\nthe fuel load. Gasoline has considerable weight—6\\npounds per gallon—30 gallons may weigh more than\\none passenger. But it must be remembered that if\\nweight is lowered by reducing fuel, the range of the air-\\nplane is decreased. During flight, fuel burn is normally\\nthe only weight change that takes place. As fuel is used,\\nthe airplane becomes lighter and performance is\\nimproved.\\nChanges of fixed equipment have a major effect upon\\nthe weight of the airplane. An airplane can be over-\\nloaded by the installation of extra radios or instruments.\\nRepairs or modifications may also affect the weight of\\nthe airplane.\\nBALANCE, STABILITY, AND \\nCENTER OF GRAVITY\\nBalance refers to the location of the center of gravity\\n(CG) of an airplane, and is important to airplane sta-\\nbility and safety in flight. The center of gravity is a\\npoint at which an airplane would balance if it were\\nsuspended at that point.\\nThe prime concern of airplane balancing is the fore\\nand aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis.\\nThe center of gravity is not necessarily a fixed point;\\nits location depends on the distribution of weight in\\nthe airplane. As variable load items are shifted or\\nexpended, there is a resultant shift in CG location. The\\npilot should realize that if the CG of an airplane is dis-\\nplaced too far forward on the longitudinal axis, a\\nnose-heavy condition will result. Conversely, if the\\nCG is displaced too far aft on the longitudinal axis, a\\ntail-heavy condition will result. It is possible that an\\nunfavorable location of the CG could produce such an\\nunstable condition that the pilot could not control the\\nairplane. [Figure 8-1]\\nLocation of the CG with reference to the lateral axis is\\nalso important. For each item of weight existing to the\\nleft of the fuselage centerline, there is an equal weight\\nexisting at a corresponding location on the right. This\\nmay be upset, however, by unbalanced lateral loading.\\nThe position of the lateral CG is not computed, but the\\npilot must be aware that adverse effects will certainly\\narise as a result of a laterally unbalanced condition.\\nLateral unbalance will occur if the fuel load is misman-\\naged by supplying the engine(s) unevenly from tanks\\non one side of the airplane. The pilot can compensate\\nfor the resulting wing-heavy condition by adjusting the\\naileron trim tab or by holding a constant aileron control\\npressure. However, this places the airplane controls in\\nan out-of-streamline condition, increases drag, and\\nresults in decreased operating efficiency. Since lateral\\nbalance is relatively easy to control and longitudinal\\nbalance is more critical, further reference to balance in\\nthis handbook will mean longitudinal location of the\\ncenter of gravity.\\nIn any event, flying an airplane that is out of balance\\ncan produce increased pilot fatigue with obvious\\neffects on the safety and efficiency of flight. The pilot’s\\nnatural correction for longitudinal unbalance is a change\\nof trim to remove the excessive control pressure.\\nExcessive trim, however, has the effect of not only\\nreducing aerodynamic efficiency but also reducing\\nprimary control travel distance in the direction the\\ntrim is applied.\\nEFFECTS OF ADVERSE BALANCE\\nAdverse balance conditions affect airplane flight\\ncharacteristics in much the same manner as those\\nmentioned for an excess weight condition. In addition,\\nthere are two essential airplane characteristics that may\\nbe seriously affected by improper balance; these are\\nstability and control. Loading in a nose-heavy condi-\\ntion causes problems in controlling and raising the\\nnose, especially during takeoff and landing. Loading\\nin a tail-heavy condition has a most serious effect\\nupon longitudinal stability, and can reduce the airplane’s\\ncapability to recover from stalls and spins. Another\\nundesirable characteristic produced from tail-heavy\\nloading is that it produces very light control forces. This\\nmakes it easy for the pilot to inadvertently overstress the\\nairplane.\\nLimits for the location of the airplane’s center of grav-\\nity are established by the manufacturer. These are the\\nfore and aft limits beyond which the CG should not be\\nlocated for flight. These limits are published for each\\nairplane in the Type Certificate Data Sheet, or Aircraft\\nSpecification and the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s\\nFigure 8-1.

If, after loading, the\\nCG is not within the allowable limits, it will be neces-\\nsary to relocate some items within the airplane before\\nflight is attempted.\\nThe forward center-of-gravity limit is often established\\nat a location that is determined by the landing charac-\\nteristics of the airplane. During landing, which is one\\nof the most critical phases of flight, exceeding the\\nforward CG limit may result in excessive loads on\\nthe nosewheel; a tendency to nose over on tailwheel-\\ntype airplanes; decreased performance; higher\\nstalling speeds; and higher control forces. In extreme\\ncases, a CG location that is forward of the forward limit\\nmay result in nose heaviness to the extent that it may\\nbe difficult or impossible to flare for landing.\\nManufacturers purposely place the forward CG limit\\nas far rearward as possible to aid pilots in avoiding\\ndamage to the airplane when landing. In addition to\\ndecreased static and dynamic longitudinal stability,\\nother undesirable effects caused by a CG location aft\\nof the allowable range may include extreme control\\ndifficulty, violent stall characteristics, and very light\\nstick forces that make it easy to overstress the airplane\\ninadvertently.\\nA restricted forward center-of-gravity limit is also\\nspecified to assure that sufficient elevator deflection is\\navailable at minimum airspeed. When structural limi-\\ntations or large stick forces do not limit the forward\\nCG position, it is located at the position where full-up\\nelevator is required to obtain a high angle of attack for\\nlanding.\\nThe aft center-of-gravity limit is the most rearward\\nposition at which the CG can be located for the most\\ncritical maneuver or operation. As the CG moves aft,\\na less stable condition occurs, which decreases the\\nability of the airplane to right itself after maneuvering\\nor turbulence.\\nFor some airplanes the CG limits, both fore and aft,\\nmay be specified to vary as gross weight changes. They\\nmay also be changed for certain operations such as\\nacrobatic flight, retraction of the landing gear, or the\\ninstallation of special loads and devices that change the\\nflight characteristics.\\nThe actual location of the CG can be altered by many\\nvariable factors and is usually controlled by the pilot.\\nPlacement of baggage and cargo items determines the\\nCG location. The assignment of seats to passengers\\ncan also be used as a means of obtaining a favorable\\nbalance. If the airplane is tail-heavy, it is only logical\\nto place heavy passengers in forward seats. Also, fuel\\nburn can affect the CG based on the location of the fuel\\ntanks.\\nMANAGEMENT OF WEIGHT AND BALANCE\\nCONTROL\\nWeight and balance control should be a matter of con-\\ncern to all pilots. The pilot has control over loading\\nand fuel management (the two variable factors that\\ncan change both total weight and CG location) of a\\nparticular airplane.\\nThe airplane owner or operator should make certain\\nthat up-to-date information is available in the airplane\\nfor the pilot’s use, and should ensure that appropriate\\nentries are made in the airplane records when repairs or\\nmodifications have been accomplished. Weight\\nchanges must be accounted for and the proper notations\\nmade in weight and balance records. The equipment\\nlist must be updated, if appropriate. Without such infor-\\nmation, the pilot has no foundation upon which to base\\nthe necessary calculations and decisions.\\nBefore any flight, the pilot should determine the\\nweight and balance condition of the airplane. Simple\\nand orderly procedures, based on sound principles,\\nhave been devised by airplane manufacturers for the\\ndetermination of loading conditions. The pilot must\\nuse these procedures and exercise good judgment. In\\nmany modern airplanes, it is not possible to fill all\\nseats, baggage compartments, and fuel tanks, and still\\nremain within the approved weight and balance limits.\\nIf the maximum passenger load is carried, the pilot\\nmust often reduce the fuel load or reduce the amount\\nof baggage.\\nTERMS AND DEFINITIONS\\nThe pilot should be familiar with terms used in working\\nthe problems related to weight and balance. The follow-\\ning list of terms and their definitions is well standardized,\\nand knowledge of these terms will aid the pilot to better\\nunderstand weight and balance calculations of any\\nairplane. Terms defined by the General Aviation\\nManufacturers Association as an industry standard are\\nmarked in the titles with GAMA.\\n• Arm (moment arm) — is the horizontal distance\\nin inches from the reference datum line to the\\ncenter of gravity of an item. The algebraic sign is\\nplus (+) if measured aft of the datum, and minus\\n(–) if measured forward of the datum.\\n• Basic empty weight ( GAMA)—includes the\\nstandard empty weight plus optional and special\\nequipment that has been installed.\\n• Center of gravity (CG )— is the point about\\nwhich an airplane would balance if it were possi-\\nble to suspend it at that point.

Once the datum has been selected,\\nall moment arms and the location of CG range are\\nmeasured from this point.\\n• Delta—is a Greek letter expressed by the symbol\\n∆ to indicate a change of values. As an example,\\n∆ CG indicates a change (or movement) of the\\nCG.\\n• Floor load limit —is the maximum weight the\\nfloor can sustain per square inch/foot as provided\\nby the manufacturer.\\n• Fuel load—is the expendable part of the load of\\nthe airplane. It includes only usable fuel, not fuel\\nrequired to fill the lines or that which remains\\ntrapped in the tank sumps.\\n• Licensed empty weight —is the empty weight\\nthat consists of the airframe, engine(s), unusable\\nfuel, and undrainable oil plus standard and\\noptional equipment as specified in the equipment\\nlist. Some manufacturers used this term prior to\\nGAMA standardization.\\n• Maximum landing weight —is the greatest\\nweight that an airplane normally is allowed to\\nhave at landing.\\n• Maximum ramp weight —is the total weight of\\na loaded aircraft, and includes all fuel. It is\\ngreater than the takeoff weight due to the fuel that\\nwill be burned during the taxi and runup opera-\\ntions. Ramp weight may also be referred to as taxi\\nweight.\\n• Maximum takeoff weight —is the maximum\\nallowable weight for takeoff.\\n• Maximum weight—is the maximum authorized\\nweight of the aircraft and all of its equipment as\\nspecified in the Type Certificate Data Sheets\\n(TCDS) for the aircraft.\\n• Maximum zero fuel weight ( GAMA)—is the\\nmaximum weight, exclusive of usable fuel.\\n• Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC)—is the aver-\\nage distance from the leading edge to the trailing\\nedge of the wing.\\n• Moment—is the product of the weight of an item\\nmultiplied by its arm. Moments are expressed in\\npound-inches (lb-in). Total moment is the weight\\nof the airplane multiplied by the distance between\\nthe datum and the CG.\\n• Moment index (or index)—is a moment divided\\nby a constant such as 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The\\npurpose of using a moment index is to simplify\\nweight and balance computations of airplanes\\nwhere heavy items and long arms result in large,\\nunmanageable numbers.\\n• Payload ( GAMA)—is the weight of occupants,\\ncargo, and baggage.\\n• Standard empty weight ( GAMA)—consists of\\nthe airframe, engines, and all items of operating\\nequipment that have fixed locations and are per-\\nmanently installed in the airplane; including fixed\\nballast, hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full\\nengine oil.\\n• Standard weights —have been established for\\nnumerous items involved in weight and balance\\ncomputations.

The datum is, therefore,\\nidentified as station zero. An item located at sta-\\ntion +50 would have an arm of 50 inches.\\n• Useful load —is the weight of the pilot, copilot,\\npassengers, baggage, usable fuel, and drainable\\noil. It is the basic empty weight subtracted from\\nthe maximum allowable gross weight. This term\\napplies to general aviation aircraft only.\\nBASIC PRINCIPLES OF WEIGHT AND \\nBALANCE COMPUTATIONS\\nIt might be advantageous at this point to review and\\ndiscuss some of the basic principles of how weight and\\nbalance can be determined. The following method of\\ncomputation can be applied to any object or vehicle\\nwhere weight and balance information is essential; but\\nCH 08.qxd  10/24/03  7:07 AM  Page 8-4'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='8-5\\nto fulfill the purpose of this handbook, it is directed\\nprimarily toward the airplane.\\nBy determining the weight of the empty airplane and\\nadding the weight of everything loaded on the air-\\nplane, a total weight can be determined. This is quite\\nsimple; but to distribute this weight in such a manner\\nthat the entire mass of the loaded airplane is balanced\\naround a point (CG), which must be located within\\nspecified limits, presents a greater problem, particu-\\nlarly if the basic principles of weight and balance are\\nnot understood.\\nThe point where the airplane will balance can be deter-\\nmined by locating the center of gravity, which is, as\\nstated in the definitions of terms, the imaginary point\\nwhere all the weight is concentrated. To provide the\\nnecessary balance between longitudinal stability and\\nelevator control, the center of gravity is usually\\nlocated slightly forward of the center of lift. This\\nloading condition causes a nose-down tendency in\\nflight, which is desirable during flight at a high angle\\nof attack and slow speeds.\\nA safe zone within which the balance point (CG) must\\nfall is called the CG range. The extremities of the range\\nare called the forward CG limits and aft CG limits.\\nThese limits are usually specified in inches, along the\\nlongitudinal axis of the airplane, measured from a datum\\nreference. The datum is an arbitrary point, established by\\nairplane designers, which may vary in location between\\ndifferent airplanes. [Figure 8-2]\\nFigure 8-2. Weight and balance illustrated.\\nThe distance from the datum to any component part\\nof the airplane, or any object loaded on the airplane,\\nis called the arm. When the object or component is\\nlocated aft of the datum, it is measured in positive\\ninches; if located forward of the datum, it is measured\\nas negative inches, or minus inches. The location of\\nthe object or part is often referred to as the station. If\\nthe weight of any object or component is multiplied\\nby the distance from the datum (arm), the product is\\nthe moment. The moment is the measurement of the\\ngravitational force that causes a tendency of the\\nweight to rotate about a point or axis and is expressed\\nin pound-inches. \\nTo illustrate, assume a weight of 50 pounds is placed\\non the board at a station or point 100 inches from the\\ndatum. The downward force of the weight can be deter-\\nmined by multiplying 50 pounds by 100 inches, which\\nproduces a moment of 5,000 lb-in. [Figure 8-3]\\nFigure 8-3. Determining moments.\\nTo establish a balance, a total of 5,000 lb-in must be\\napplied to the other end of the board. Any combination\\nof weight and distance which, when multiplied, pro-\\nduces a 5,000 lb-in moment will balance the board. For\\nexample, as illustrated in figure 8-4, if a 100-pound\\nweight is placed at a point (station) 25 inches from the\\ndatum, and another 50-pound weight is placed at a\\npoint (station) 50 inches from the datum, the sum of the\\nproduct of the two weights and their distances will total\\na moment of 5,000 lb-in, which will balance the board.\\nFigure 8-4.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='8-6\\nWEIGHT AND BALANCE RESTRICTIONS\\nThe airplane’s weight and balance restrictions should\\nbe closely followed. The loading conditions and empty\\nweight of a particular airplane may differ from that\\nfound in the AFM/POH because modifications or\\nequipment changes may have been made. Sample\\nloading problems in the AFM/POH are intended for\\nguidance only; therefore, each airplane must be\\ntreated separately. Although an airplane is certified\\nfor a specified maximum gross takeoff weight, it will\\nnot safely take off with this load under all conditions.\\nConditions that affect takeoff and climb performance\\nsuch as high elevations, high temperatures, and high\\nhumidity (high-density altitudes) may require a reduc-\\ntion in weight before flight is attempted. Other factors\\nto consider prior to takeoff are runway length, runway\\nsurface, runway slope, surface wind, and the presence\\nof obstacles. These factors may require a reduction in\\nweight prior to flight.\\nSome airplanes are designed so that it is difficult to\\nload them in a manner that will place the CG out of\\nlimits. These are usually small airplanes with the seats,\\nfuel, and baggage areas located near the CG limit.\\nThese airplanes, however, can be overloaded in\\nweight.\\nOther airplanes can be loaded in such a manner that\\nthey will be out of CG limits even though the useful\\nload has not been exceeded.\\nBecause of the effects of an out-of-balance or over-\\nweight condition, a pilot should always be sure that an\\nairplane is properly loaded.\\nDETERMINING LOADED WEIGHT AND\\nCENTER OF GRAVITY\\nThere are various methods for determining the loaded\\nweight and center of gravity of an aircraft. There is the\\ncomputation method, as well as methods that utilize\\ngraphs and tables provided by the aircraft manufac-\\nturer.\\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHOD\\nThe computational method involves the application of\\nbasic math functions. The following is an example of\\nthe computational method.\\nGiven:\\nMaximum Gross Weight  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3400 lb\\nCenter-of-Gravity Range  . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78-86 in\\nFront Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 340 lb\\nRear Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 350 lb\\nFuel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75 gal\\nBaggage Area 1  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80 lb\\nTo determine the loaded weight and CG, follow these\\nsteps.\\nStep 1 —List the weight of the airplane, occu-\\npants, fuel, and baggage. Remember that fuel\\nweighs 6 pounds per gallon.\\nStep 2—Enter the moment for each item listed.\\nRemember “weight x arm = moment.” \\nStep 3—Total the weight and moments.\\nStep 4 —To determine the CG, divide the total\\nmoment by the total weight.\\nNOTE: The weight and balance records for a particular\\nairplane will provide the empty weight and moment as\\nwell as the information on the arm distance.\\nThe total loaded weight of 3,320 pounds does not\\nexceed the maximum gross weight of 3,400 pounds and\\nthe CG of 84.8 is within the 78-86 inch range; there-\\nfore, the airplane is loaded within limits.\\nGRAPH METHOD\\nAnother method for determining the loaded weight and\\nCG is the use of graphs provided by the manufacturers.\\nTo simplify calculations, the moment may sometimes\\nbe divided by 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The following is\\nan example of the graph method. [Figures 8-5 and 8-6] \\nGiven:\\nFront Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 340 lb\\nRear Seat Occupants  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 300 lb\\nFuel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 gal\\nBaggage Area 1  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 lb\\nThe same steps should be followed as in the computa-\\ntional method except the graphs provided will calculate\\nthe moments and allow the pilot to determine if the\\nairplane is loaded within limits.

All other moments were\\ndetermined in the same way.) Once this has been done\\nfor each item, total the weight and moments and draw a\\nline for both weight and moment on the center-of-grav-\\nity envelope graph. If the lines intersect within the\\nenvelope, the airplane is loaded within limits.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='8-8\\nTABLE METHOD\\nThe table method applies the same principles as the\\ncomputational and graph methods. The information\\nand limitations are contained in tables provided by the\\nmanufacturer. Figure 8-7 is an example of a table and a\\nweight and balance calculation based on that table. In\\nthis problem, the total weight of 2,799 pounds and\\nmoment of 2,278/100 are within the limits of the table.\\nFigure 8-7.

It is important\\nto remember that a positive times a negative equals a\\nnegative, and a negative would be subtracted from the\\ntotal moments.\\nCH 08.qxd  10/24/03  7:07 AM  Page 8-8'),\n",

In this\\nexample, the total weight of the airplane less fuel is\\n4,240 pounds, which is under the zero fuel weight of\\n4,400 pounds. If the total weight of the airplane\\nwithout fuel had exceeded 4,400 pounds, passengers\\nor cargo would have to be reduced to bring the\\nweight at or below the max zero fuel weight.\\nSHIFTING, ADDING, AND REMOVING\\nWEIGHT\\nA pilot must be able to accurately and rapidly solve any\\nproblems that involve the shift, addition, or removal of\\nweight. For example, the pilot may load the aircraft\\nwithin the allowable takeoff weight limit, then find a\\nCG limit has been exceeded. The most satisfactory\\nsolution to this problem is to shift baggage, passen-\\ngers, or both. The pilot should be able to determine the\\nminimum load shift needed to make the aircraft safe\\nfor flight. Pilots should be able to determine if shifting\\na load to a new location will correct an out-of-limit\\ncondition. There are some standardized calculations\\nthat can help make these determinations.\\nWEIGHT SHIFTING\\nWhen weight is shifted from one location to another,\\nthe total weight of the aircraft is unchanged. The total\\nmoments, however, do change in relation and propor-\\ntion to the direction and distance the weight is moved.\\nWhen weight is moved forward, the total moments\\ndecrease; when weight is moved aft, total moments\\nincrease. The moment change is proportional to the\\namount of weight moved. Since many aircraft have\\nforward and aft baggage compartments, weight may\\nbe shifted from one to the other to change the CG. If\\nstarting with a known aircraft weight, CG, and total\\nmoments, calculate the new CG (after the weight shift)\\nby dividing the new total moments by the total aircraft\\nweight.\\nTo determine the new total moments, find out how\\nmany moments are gained or lost when the weight is\\nshifted. Assume that 100 pounds has been shifted from\\nstation 30 to station 150. This movement increases the\\ntotal moments of the aircraft by 12,000 lb-in.\\nMoment when \\nat station 150 = 100 lb x 150 in = 15,000 lb-in\\nMoment when \\nat station   30 = 100 lb  x  30 in = 3,000 lb-in\\nMoment change                              = 12,000 lb-in\\nBy adding the moment change to the original moment\\n(or subtracting if the weight has been moved forward\\ninstead of aft), the new total moments are obtained.\\nThen determine the new CG by dividing the new\\nmoments by the total weight:\\nTotal moments = 616,000 + 12,000 = 628,000\\nCG =          628,000 = 78.5 in\\n8,000 (Total weight)\\nThe shift has caused the CG to shift to station 78.5\\nA simpler solution may be obtained by using a com-\\nputer or calculator and a proportional formula. This\\ncan be done because the CG will shift a distance that is\\nproportional to the distance the weight is shifted.\\nFigure 8-8. Sample weight and balance using a negative.\\nFigure 8-9.

The use\\nof this data in flying operations is mandatory for safe\\nand efficient operation. Considerable knowledge and\\nfamiliarity of the airplane can be gained through study\\nof this material.\\nIt must be emphasized that the manufacturers’\\ninformation and data furnished in the AFM/POH is\\nnot standardized. Some provide the data in tabular\\nform, while others use graphs. In addition, the per-\\nformance data may be presented on the basis of\\nstandard atmospheric conditions, pressure altitude,\\nor density altitude. The performance information in\\nthe AFM/POH has little or no value unless the user\\nrecognizes those variations and makes the necessary\\nadjustments.\\nTo be able to make practical use of the airplane’s capa-\\nbilities and limitations, it is essential to understand the\\nsignificance of the operational data. The pilot must be\\ncognizant of the basis for the performance data, as well\\nas the meanings of the various terms used in expressing\\nperformance capabilities and limitations. \\nSince the characteristics of the atmosphere have a pre-\\ndominant effect on performance, it is necessary to\\nreview some of the dominant factors—pressure and\\ntemperature.\\nSTRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE\\nThe atmosphere is an envelope of air that surrounds the\\nearth and rests upon its surface. It is as much a part of\\nthe earth as the seas or the land. However, air differs\\nfrom land and water inasmuch as it is a mixture of\\ngases. It has mass, weight, and indefinite shape.\\nAir, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its\\nshape when subjected to even minute pressures because\\nof the lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example,\\ngas will completely fill any container into which it is\\nplaced, expanding or contracting to adjust its shape to\\nthe limits of the container.\\nThe atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21\\npercent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as\\nargon or helium. Most of the oxygen is contained\\nbelow 35,000 feet altitude.\\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nThough there are various kinds of pressure, pilots are\\nmainly concerned with atmospheric pressure. It is one\\nof the basic factors in weather changes, helps to lift the\\nairplane, and actuates some of the important flight\\ninstruments in the airplane. These instruments are the\\naltimeter, the airspeed indicator, the rate-of-climb indi-\\ncator, and the manifold pressure gauge.\\nThough air is very light, it has mass and is affected\\nby the attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other\\nCh 09.qxd  10/24/03  7:23 AM  Page 9-1'),\n",

Since it is a fluid substance, this force is\\nexerted equally in all directions, and its effect on\\nbodies within the air is called pressure. Under stan-\\ndard conditions at sea level, the average pressure\\nexerted by the weight of the atmosphere is approxi-\\nmately 14.7 lb./in. The density of air has significant\\neffects on the airplane’s performance. As air\\nbecomes less dense, it reduces: \\n• power because the engine takes in less air, \\n• thrust because the propeller is less efficient in\\nthin air, and \\n• lift because the thin air exerts less force on the\\nairfoils.\\nThe pressure of the atmosphere varies with time and\\nlocation. Due to the changing atmospheric pressure, a\\nstandard reference was developed. The standard atmos-\\nphere at sea level is a surface temperature of 59 °F or\\n15°C and a surface pressure of 29.92 in. Hg or 1013.2\\nmillibars. [Figure 9-1]\\nA standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the\\ntemperature decreases at the rate of approximately\\n3.5°F or 2°C per thousand feet up to 36,000 feet. Above\\nthis point, the temperature is considered constant up to\\n80,000 feet. A standard pressure lapse rate is one in\\nwhich pressure decreases at a rate of approximately 1\\nin. Hg per 1,000 feet of altitude gain to 10,000 feet.\\n[Figure 9-2] The International Civil Aviation\\nOrganization (ICAO) has established this as a world-\\nwide standard, and it is often referred to as\\nInternational Standard Atmosphere (ISA) or ICAO\\nStandard Atmosphere. Any temperature or pressure that\\ndiffers from the standard lapse rates is considered non-\\nstandard temperature and pressure. Adjustments for\\nnonstandard temperatures and pressures are provided\\non the manufacturer’s performance charts. \\nSince all airplane performance is compared and evalu-\\nated with respect to the standard atmosphere, all air-\\ncraft instruments are calibrated for the standard\\natmosphere. Thus, certain corrections must apply to the\\ninstrumentation, as well as the airplane performance, if\\nthe actual operating conditions do not fit the standard\\natmosphere. In order to account properly for the non-\\nstandard atmosphere, certain related terms must be\\ndefined.\\nPRESSURE ALTITUDE\\nPressure altitude is the height above a standard datum\\nplane. The airplane altimeter is essentially a sensitive\\nbarometer calibrated to indicate altitude in the standard\\natmosphere. If the altimeter is set for 29.92 in. Hg\\nStandard Datum Plane (SDP), the altitude indicated is\\nthe pressure altitude—the altitude in the standard\\natmosphere corresponding to the sensed pressure.\\nThe SDP is a theoretical level where the weight of the\\natmosphere is 29.92 in.

As the density of the air increases\\n(lower density altitude), airplane performance increases\\nand conversely as air density decreases (higher density\\naltitude), airplane performance decreases. A decrease in\\nair density means a high density altitude; and an\\nincrease in air density means a lower density altitude.\\nDensity altitude is used in calculating airplane perform-\\nance. Under standard atmospheric condition, air at each\\nlevel in the atmosphere has a specific density, and under\\nstandard conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude\\nidentify the same level. Density altitude, then, is the ver-\\ntical distance above sea level in the standard atmosphere\\nat which a given density is to be found.\\nThe computation of density altitude must involve\\nconsideration of pressure (pressure altitude) and\\ntemperature. Since airplane performance data at\\nany level is based upon air density under standard\\nday conditions, such performance data apply to air\\ndensity levels that may not be identical with altime-\\nter indications. Under conditions higher or lower\\nthan standard, these levels cannot be determined\\ndirectly from the altimeter.\\nDensity altitude is determined by first finding pressure\\naltitude, and then correcting this altitude for nonstan-\\ndard temperature variations. Since density varies\\ndirectly with pressure, and inversely with temperature,\\na given pressure altitude may exist for a wide range of\\ntemperature by allowing the density to vary. However,\\na known density occurs for any one temperature and\\npressure altitude. The density of the air, of course, has a\\npronounced effect on airplane and engine performance.\\nRegardless of the actual altitude at which the airplane\\nis operating, it will perform as though it were operating\\nat an altitude equal to the existing density altitude.\\nFor example, when set at 29.92, the altimeter may indi-\\ncate a pressure altitude of 5,000 feet. According to the\\nAFM/POH, the ground run on takeoff may require a dis-\\ntance of 790 feet under standard temperature conditions.\\nHowever, if the temperature is 20°C above standard, the\\nexpansion of air raises the density level. Using tempera-\\nture correction data from tables or graphs, or by deriving\\nthe density altitude with a computer, it may be found that\\nthe density level is above 7,000 feet, and the ground run\\nmay be closer to 1,000 feet.\\nAir density is affected by changes in altitude, temper-\\nature, and humidity. High density altitude refers to\\nthin air while low density altitude refers to dense air.\\nThe conditions that result in a high density altitude\\nare high elevations, low atmospheric pressures, high\\ntemperatures, high humidity, or some combination of\\nthese factors. Lower elevations, high atmospheric\\npressure, low temperatures, and low humidity are\\nmore indicative of low density altitude.\\nUsing a flight computer, density altitude can be com-\\nputed by inputting the pressure altitude and outside air\\ntemperature at flight level. Density altitude can also be\\ndetermined by referring to the table and chart in figures\\n9-3 and 9-4.\\nMethod for Determining\\nPressure Altitude\\nAlternate Method for Determining\\nPressure Altitude\\nIf Altimeter\\nSetting is:\\nAltitude\\nCorrection\\n28.0\\n28.1\\n28.2\\n28.3\\n28.4\\n28.5\\n28.6\\n28.7\\n28.8\\n28.9\\n29.0\\n29.1\\n29.2\\n29.3\\n29.4\\n29.5\\n29.6\\n29.7\\n29.8\\n29.9\\n29.92\\n30.0\\n30.1\\n30.2\\n30.3\\n30.4\\n30.5\\n30.6\\n30.7\\n30.8\\n30.9\\n31.0\\n1,825\\n1,725\\n1,630\\n1,535\\n1,435\\n1,340\\n1,245\\n1,150\\n1,050\\n955\\n865\\n770\\n675\\n580\\n485\\n390\\n300\\n205\\n110\\n20\\n0\\n-75\\n-165\\n-255\\n-350\\n-440\\n-530\\n-620\\n-710\\n-805\\n-895\\n-965\\nTo Get\\nPressure Altitude\\nSet 29.92 in pressure\\nwindow of altimeter and\\nread altitude.

Conversely, when pressure on\\na given volume of air is decreased, the air expands and\\noccupies a greater space. That is, the original column\\nof air at a lower pressure contains a smaller mass of air.\\nIn other words, the density is decreased. In fact, density\\nis directly proportional to pressure. If the pressure is\\ndoubled, the density is doubled, and if the pressure is\\nlowered, so is the density. This statement is true only at\\na constant temperature.\\nEFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON DENSITY\\nIncreasing the temperature of a substance decreases its\\ndensity. Conversely, decreasing the temperature\\nincreases the density. Thus, the density of air varies\\ninversely with temperature. This statement is true only\\nat a constant pressure.\\nIn the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure\\ndecrease with altitude, and have conflicting effects\\nupon density. However, the fairly rapid drop in pres-\\nsure as altitude is increased usually has the dominating\\neffect. Hence, pilots can expect the density to decrease\\nwith altitude.\\nEFFECT OF HUMIDITY (MOISTURE) ON\\nDENSITY\\nThe preceding paragraphs have assumed that the air\\nwas perfectly dry. In reality, it is never completely dry.\\nThe small amount of water vapor suspended in the\\natmosphere may be almost negligible under certain\\nconditions, but in other conditions humidity may\\nbecome an important factor in the performance of an\\nairplane. Water vapor is lighter than air; consequently,\\nmoist air is lighter than dry air. Therefore, as the water\\ncontent of the air increases, the air becomes less dense,\\nincreasing density altitude and decreasing perform-\\nance. It is lightest or least dense when, in a given set of\\nconditions, it contains the maximum amount of water\\nvapor.\\nHumidity, also called “relative humidity,” refers to the\\namount of water vapor contained in the atmosphere,\\nand is expressed as a percentage of the maximum\\namount of water vapor the air can hold. This amount\\nvaries with the temperature; warm air can hold more\\nwater vapor, while colder air can hold less. Perfectly\\ndry air that contains no water vapor has a relative\\nhumidity of 0 percent, while saturated air, that cannot\\nhold any more water vapor, has a relative humidity of\\n100 percent. Humidity alone is usually not considered\\nan important factor in calculating density altitude and\\nairplane performance; however, it does contribute.\\nThe higher the temperature, the greater amount of water\\nvapor that the air can hold. When comparing two separate\\nair masses, the first warm and moist (both qualities tending\\nto lighten the air) and the second cold and dry (both quali-\\nties making it heavier), the first necessarily must be less\\ndense than the second. Pressure, temperature, and humidity\\nhave a great influence on airplane performance because of\\ntheir effect upon density. There are no rules-of-thumb or\\ncharts used to compute the effects of humidity on density\\naltitude, so take this into consideration by expecting a\\ndecrease in overall performance in high humidity\\nconditions.\\nPERFORMANCE\\n“Performance” is a term used to describe the ability of\\nan airplane to accomplish certain things that make it\\nFigure 9-4.

For example, the ability of\\nthe airplane to land and take off in a very short distance\\nis an important factor to the pilot who operates in and\\nout of short, unimproved airfields. The ability to carry\\nheavy loads, fly at high altitudes at fast speeds, or travel\\nlong distances is essential performance for operators of\\nairline and executive type airplanes.\\nThe chief elements of performance are the takeoff and\\nlanding distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload, range,\\nspeed, maneuverability, stability, and fuel economy.\\nSome of these factors are often directly opposed: for\\nexample, high speed versus shortness of landing dis-\\ntance; long range versus great payload; and high rate of\\nclimb versus fuel economy. It is the preeminence of one\\nor more of these factors which dictates differences\\nbetween airplanes and which explains the high degree\\nof specialization found in modern airplanes.\\nThe various items of airplane performance result from the\\ncombination of airplane and powerplant characteristics.\\nThe aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane generally\\ndefine the power and thrust requirements at various condi-\\ntions of flight while powerplant characteristics generally\\ndefine the power and thrust available at various conditions\\nof flight. The matching of the aerodynamic configuration\\nwith the powerplant is accomplished by the manufacturer\\nto provide maximum performance at the specific design\\ncondition; e.g., range, endurance, and climb.\\nSTRAIGHT-AND-LEVEL FLIGHT\\nAll of the principal items of flight performance involve\\nsteady-state flight conditions and equilibrium of the\\nairplane. For the airplane to remain in steady, level\\nflight, equilibrium must be obtained by a lift equal to\\nthe airplane weight and a powerplant thrust equal to the\\nairplane drag. Thus, the airplane drag defines the thrust\\nrequired to maintain steady, level flight.\\nAll parts of the airplane that are exposed to the air con-\\ntribute to the drag, though only the wings provide lift\\nof any significance. For this reason, and certain others\\nrelated to it, the total drag may be divided into two\\nparts: the wing drag (induced) and the drag of every-\\nthing but the wings (parasite).\\nThe total power required for flight then can be considered\\nas the sum of induced and parasite effects; that is, the total\\ndrag of the airplane. Parasite drag is the sum of pressure\\nand friction drag, which is due to the airplane’s basic con-\\nfiguration and, as defined, is independent of lift. Induced\\ndrag is the undesirable but unavoidable consequence of\\nthe development of lift.\\nWhile the parasite drag predominates at high speed,\\ninduced drag predominates at low speed. [Figure 9-5]\\nFor example, if an airplane in a steady flight condi-\\ntion at 100 knots is then accelerated to 200 knots, the\\nparasite drag becomes four times as great, but the\\npower required to overcome that drag is eight times\\nthe original value. Conversely, when the airplane is\\noperated in steady, level flight at twice as great a\\nspeed, the induced drag is one-fourth the original\\nvalue, and the power required to overcome that drag\\nis only one-half the original value.\\nThe wing or induced drag changes with speed in a very\\ndifferent way, because of the changes in the angle of\\nattack. Near the stalling speed, the wing is inclined to\\nthe relative wind at nearly the stalling angle, and its\\ndrag is very strong. But at cruise flying speed, with the\\nangle of attack nearly zero, induced drag is minimal.\\nAfter attaining cruise speed, the angle of attack changes\\nvery little with any further increase in speed, and the\\ndrag of the wing increases in direct proportion to any\\nfurther increase in speed. This does not consider the\\nfactor of compressibility drag that is involved at speeds\\nbeyond 260 knots.\\nTo sum up these changes, as the speed increases from\\nstalling speed to VNE, the induced drag decreases and\\nparasite drag increases.\\nWhen the airplane is in steady, level flight, the condi-\\ntion of equilibrium must prevail. The unaccelerated\\ncondition of flight is achieved with the airplane\\ntrimmed for lift equal to weight and the powerplant set\\nfor a thrust to equal the airplane drag.\\nThe maximum level flight speed for the airplane will\\nbe obtained when the power or thrust required equals\\nthe maximum power or thrust available from the\\nSpeed—Knots\\nDrag—Pounds\\nParasite Drag\\nInduced Drag\\nTotal Drag\\nStall\\nFigure 9-5.

[Figure 9-6] The minimum level flight\\nairspeed is not usually defined by thrust or power\\nrequirement since conditions of stall or stability and\\ncontrol problems generally predominate.\\nCLIMB PERFORMANCE\\nClimb depends upon the reserve power or thrust.\\nReserve power is the available power over and above\\nthat required to maintain horizontal flight at a given\\nspeed. Thus, if an airplane is equipped with an engine\\nthat produces 200 total available horsepower and the\\nairplane requires only 130 horsepower at a certain level\\nflight speed, the power available for climb is 70 horse-\\npower.\\nAlthough the terms “ power” and “thrust” are some-\\ntimes used interchangeably, erroneously implying that\\nthey are synonymous, it is important to distinguish\\nbetween the two when discussing climb performance.\\nWork is the product of a force moving through a\\ndistance and is usually independent of time. Work is\\nmeasured by several standards; the most common unit\\nis called a “foot-pound.” If a 1-pound mass is raised 1\\nfoot, a work unit of 1 foot-pound has been performed.\\nThe common unit of mechanical power is horse-\\npower; one horsepower is work equivalent to lifting\\n33,000 pounds a vertical distance of 1 foot in 1\\nminute. The term “power” implies work rate or units\\nof work per unit of time, and as such is a function of\\nthe speed at which the force is developed. “Thrust,”\\nalso a function of work, means the force that imparts\\na change in the velocity of a mass. This force is meas-\\nured in pounds but has no element of time or rate. It\\ncan be said then, that during a steady climb, the rate\\nof climb is a function of excess thrust.\\nWhen the airplane is in steady, level flight or with a\\nslight angle of climb, the vertical component of lift is\\nvery nearly the same as the actual total lift. Such climb-\\ning flight would exist with the lift very nearly equal to\\nthe weight. The net thrust of the powerplant may be\\ninclined relative to the flightpath, but this effect will be\\nneglected here for the sake of simplicity. Although the\\nweight of the airplane acts vertically, a component of\\nweight will act rearward along the flightpath. [Figure\\n9-7]\\nIf it is assumed that the airplane is in a steady climb\\nwith essentially a small inclination of the flightpath,\\nthe summation of forces along the flightpath resolves\\nto the following:\\nForces forward = Forces aft\\nThe basic relationship neglects some of the factors\\nthat may be of importance for airplanes of very high\\nclimb performance. (For example, a more detailed\\nconsideration would account for the inclination of\\nthrust from the flightpath, lift not being equal to\\nweight, and a subsequent change of induced drag.)\\nHowever, this basic relationship will define the\\nprincipal factors affecting climb performance.\\nThis relationship means that, for a given weight of the\\nairplane, the angle of climb depends on the difference\\nbetween thrust and drag, or the excess thrust. [Figure\\n9-8] Of course, when the excess thrust is zero, the incli-\\nnation of the flightpath is zero, and the airplane will be\\nin steady, level flight. When the thrust is greater than\\nthe drag, the excess thrust will allow a climb angle\\ndepending on the value of excess thrust. On the other\\nhand, when the thrust is less than the drag, the defi-\\nciency of thrust will allow an angle of descent.\\nThe most immediate interest in the climb angle\\nperformance involves obstacle clearance.

The vertical velocity of an\\nairplane depends on the flight speed and the inclination\\nof the flightpath. In fact, the rate of climb is the vertical\\ncomponent of the flightpath velocity.\\nFor rate of climb, the maximum rate would occur\\nwhere there exists the greatest difference between\\npower available and power required. [Figure 9-9] The\\nabove relationship means that, for a given weight of the\\nairplane, the rate of climb depends on the difference\\nbetween the power available and the power required, or\\nthe excess power. Of course, when the excess power is\\nzero, the rate of climb is zero and the airplane is in\\nsteady, level flight. When power available is greater\\nthan the power required, the excess power will allow a\\nrate of climb specific to the magnitude of excess power.\\nDuring a steady climb, the rate of climb will depend on\\nexcess power while the angle of climb is a function of\\nexcess thrust.\\nThe climb performance of an airplane is affected by\\ncertain variables. The conditions of the airplane’s\\nmaximum climb angle or maximum climb rate\\noccur at specific speeds, and variations in speed\\nwill produce variations in climb performance.\\nThere is sufficient latitude in most airplanes that\\nsmall variations in speed from the optimum do not\\nproduce large changes in climb performance, and\\ncertain operational considerations may require\\nspeeds slightly different from the optimum. Of\\ncourse, climb performance would be most critical\\nwith high gross weight, at high altitude, in\\nobstructed takeoff areas, or during malfunction of a\\npowerplant. Then, optimum climb speeds are nec-\\nessary.\\nWeight has a very pronounced effect on airplane per-\\nformance. If weight is added to the airplane, it must fly\\nat a higher angle of attack to maintain a given altitude\\nand speed. This increases the induced drag of the\\nwings, as well as the parasite drag of the airplane.\\nIncreased drag means that additional thrust is needed to\\novercome it, which in turn means that less reserve\\nthrust is available for climbing. Airplane designers go\\nto great effort to minimize the weight since it has such\\na marked effect on the factors pertaining to perform-\\nance.\\nA change in the airplane’s weight produces a twofold\\neffect on climb performance. First, a change in weight\\nwill change the drag and the power required. This alters\\nthe reserve power available, which in turn, affects both\\nthe climb angle and the climb rate. Secondly, an\\nincrease in weight will reduce the maximum rate of\\nclimb, but the airplane must be operated at a higher\\nclimb speed to achieve the smaller peak climb rate.\\nAn increase in altitude also will increase the power\\nrequired and decrease the power available. Therefore,\\nthe climb performance of an airplane diminishes with\\naltitude. The speeds for maximum rate of climb, maxi-\\nmum angle of climb, and maximum and minimum\\nlevel flight airspeeds vary with altitude. As altitude is\\nincreased, these various speeds finally converge at the\\nabsolute ceiling of the airplane.

The\\nservice ceiling is the altitude at which the airplane is\\nunable to climb at a rate greater than 100 feet per\\nminute. Usually, these specific performance reference\\npoints are provided for the airplane at a specific design\\nconfiguration. [Figure 9-10]\\nIn discussing performance, it frequently is convenient\\nto use the terms “power loading” and “wing loading.”\\nPower loading is expressed in pounds per horsepower\\nand is obtained by dividing the total weight of the air-\\nplane by the rated horsepower of the engine. It is a sig-\\nnificant factor in the airplane’s takeoff and climb\\ncapabilities. Wing loading is expressed in pounds per\\nsquare foot and is obtained by dividing the total weight\\nof the airplane in pounds by the wing area (including\\nailerons) in square feet. It is the airplane’s wing loading\\nthat determines the landing speed. These factors are\\ndiscussed in subsequent sections of this chapter.\\nRANGE PERFORMANCE\\nThe ability of an airplane to convert fuel energy into\\nflying distance is one of the most important items of\\nairplane performance. In flying operations, the prob-\\nlem of efficient range operation of an airplane appears\\nin two general forms: \\n1. to extract the maximum flying distance from a\\ngiven fuel load or, \\n2. to fly a specified distance with a minimum\\nexpenditure of fuel. \\nA common denominator for each of these operating\\nproblems is the “specific range”; that is, nautical miles\\nof flying distance per pound of fuel. Cruise flight\\noperations for maximum range should be conducted\\nso that the airplane obtains maximum specific range\\nthroughout the flight.\\nThe specific range can be defined by the following\\nrelationship:\\nnautical miles\\nspecific range  =  —————————-\\nlb. of fuel\\nor,\\nnautical miles/hr.\\nspecific range  =  ——————————-\\nlb. of fuel/hr.\\nor,\\nknots\\nspecific range  =  —————-\\nfuel flow\\nIf maximum specific range is desired, the flight condi-\\ntion must provide a maximum of speed per fuel flow.\\nRange must be clearly distinguished from the item of\\nendurance. [Figure 9-11] The item of range involves\\nconsideration of flying distance, while endurance\\ninvolves consideration of flying time. Thus, it is appro-\\npriate to define a separate term, “specific endurance.”\\nflight hours\\nspecific endurance  =  ———————-\\nlb. of fuel\\nor,\\nflight hours/hr.\\nspecific endurance  =  —————————\\nlb. of fuel/hr.\\nor,\\n1\\nspecific endurance  =  —————-\\nfuel flow\\nIf maximum endurance is desired, the flight condition\\nmust provide a minimum of fuel flow. While the peak\\nvalue of specific range would provide maximum range\\noperation, long-range cruise operation is generally rec-\\nommended at some slightly higher airspeed. Most\\nlong-range cruise operations are conducted at the flight\\ncondition that provides 99 percent of the absolute max-\\nimum specific range. The advantage of such operation\\nis that 1 percent of range is traded for 3 to 5 percent\\nhigher cruise speed. Since the higher cruise speed has a\\ngreat number of advantages, the small sacrifice of\\n9-8\\nAbsolute Ceiling\\nService Ceiling\\nFigure 9-10.

The values of specific range ver-\\nsus speed are affected by three principal variables: \\n1. airplane gross weight, \\n2. altitude, and \\n3. the external aerodynamic configuration of the air-\\nplane. These are the source of range and\\nendurance operating data included in the per-\\nformance section of the AFM/POH.\\n“Cruise control” of an airplane implies that the airplane\\nis operated to maintain the recommended long-range\\ncruise condition throughout the flight. Since fuel is\\nconsumed during cruise, the gross weight of the air-\\nplane will vary and optimum airspeed, altitude, and\\npower setting can also vary. “Cruise control” means the\\ncontrol of the optimum airspeed, altitude, and power\\nsetting to maintain the 99 percent maximum specific\\nrange condition. At the beginning of cruise flight, the\\nrelatively high initial weight of the airplane will require\\nspecific values of airspeed, altitude, and power setting\\nto produce the recommended cruise condition. As fuel\\nis consumed and the airplane’s gross weight decreases,\\nthe optimum airspeed and power setting may decrease,\\nor, the optimum altitude may increase. In addition, the\\noptimum specific range will increase. Therefore, the\\npilot must provide the proper cruise control procedure\\nto ensure that optimum conditions are maintained.\\nTotal range is dependent on both fuel available\\nand specific range. When range and economy of\\noperation are the principal goals, the pilot must\\nensure that the airplane will be operated at the\\nrecommended long- range cruise condition. By\\nthis procedure, the airplane will be capable of its\\nmaximum design-operating radius, or can\\nachieve flight distances less than the maximum\\nwith a maximum of fuel reserve at the destina-\\ntion.\\nThe propeller-driven airplane combines the propeller with\\nthe reciprocating engine for propulsive power. In the case\\nof the reciprocating engine, fuel flow is determined\\nmainly by the shaft power put into the propeller rather\\nthan thrust. Thus, the fuel flow can be related directly to\\nthe power required to maintain the airplane in steady, level\\nflight. This fact allows for the determination of range\\nthrough analysis of power required versus speed.\\nThe maximum endurance condition would be obtained\\nat the point of minimum power required since this\\nwould require the lowest fuel flow to keep the airplane\\nin steady, level flight. Maximum range condition would\\noccur where the proportion between speed and power\\nrequired is greatest. [Figure 9-11] \\nThe maximum range condition is obtained at maximum\\nlift/drag ratio (L/D max), and it is important to note that\\nfor a given airplane configuration, the maximum\\nlift/drag ratio occurs at a particular angle of attack and\\nlift coefficient, and is unaffected by weight or altitude.\\nA variation in weight will alter the values of airspeed\\nand power required to obtained the maximum lift/drag\\nratio. [Figure 9-12]\\nThe variations of speed and power required must\\nbe monitored by the pilot as part of the cruise\\ncontrol procedure to maintain the maximum\\nlift/drag ratio. When the airplane’s fuel weight is\\na small part of the gross weight and the airplane’s\\nrange is small, the cruise control procedure can\\nbe simplified to essentially maintaining a con-\\nstant speed and power setting throughout the\\ntime of cruise flight. The long-range airplane has\\na fuel weight that is a considerable part of the\\ngross weight, and cruise control procedures must\\nemploy scheduled airspeed and power changes to\\nmaintain optimum range conditions.\\nSpeed—Knots\\n Power Required—HP\\nMaximum\\nRange at\\n(L/D) MAX\\nMaximum\\nEndurance\\nat Min.

A flight conducted at high altitude will\\nhave a greater true airspeed, and the power required\\nwill be proportionately greater than when conducted\\nat sea level. The drag of the airplane at altitude is the\\nsame as the drag at sea level, but the higher true\\nairspeed causes a proportionately greater power\\nrequired. Note that the straight line that is tangent\\nto the sea level power curve is also tangent to the\\naltitude power curve.\\nThe effect of altitude on specific range also can be\\nappreciated from the previous relationships. If a change\\nin altitude causes identical changes in speed and power\\nrequired, the proportion of speed to power required\\nwould be unchanged. The fact implies that the specific\\nrange of the propeller-driven airplane would be unaf-\\nfected by altitude. Actually, this is true to the extent that\\nspecific fuel consumption and propeller efficiency are\\nthe principal factors that could cause a variation of spe-\\ncific range with altitude. If compressibility effects are\\nnegligible, any variation of specific range with altitude\\nis strictly a function of engine/propeller performance.\\nThe airplane equipped with the reciprocating engine\\nwill experience very little, if any, variation of specific\\nrange up to its absolute altitude. There is negligible\\nvariation of brake specific fuel consumption for val-\\nues of brake horsepower below the maximum cruise\\npower rating of the engine that is the lean range of\\nengine operation. Thus, an increase in altitude will\\nproduce a decrease in specific range only when the\\nincreased power requirement exceeds the maximum\\ncruise power rating of the engine. One advantage of\\nsupercharging is that the cruise power may be main-\\ntained at high altitude, and the airplane may achieve\\nthe range at high altitude with the corresponding\\nincrease in true airspeed. The principal differences in\\nthe high altitude cruise and low altitude cruise are the\\ntrue airspeeds and climb fuel requirements.\\nGROUND EFFECT\\nGround effect is due to the interference of the\\nsurface with the flow pattern about the airplane\\nin flight. Ground effect can be detected and\\nmeasured up to an altitude equal to one wing\\nspan above the surface. However, ground effect\\nis most significant when the airplane (especially\\nthe low-wing airplane) is maintaining a constant\\nattitude at low airspeed and low altitude (for\\nexample, during landing flare before touchdown,\\nand during takeoff when the airplane lifts off and\\naccelerates to climb speed).\\nWhen the wing is under the influence of ground\\neffect, there is a reduction in upwash, downwash, and\\ntip vortices. As a result of the reduced tip vortices,\\ninduced drag is reduced. When the wing is at a height\\nequal to one-fourth the span, the reduction in induced\\ndrag is about 25 percent, and when the wing is at a\\nheight equal to one-tenth the span, the reduction in\\ninduced drag is about 50 percent. At high speeds\\nwhere parasite drag predominates, induced drag is a\\nsmall part of the total drag. Consequently, the effects\\nof ground effect are of greater concern during takeoff\\nand landing. [Figure 9-14]\\nAssuming that the airplane descends into ground effect\\nmaintaining a constant angle of attack and a constant\\nairspeed, the following effects will take place:\\nBecause of the reduction in drag, a smaller wing\\nangle of attack will be required to produce the same\\nlift coefficient or, if a constant wing angle of attack\\nis maintained, the wing will experience an increase\\nin lift coefficient.\\nAs a result of the reduction in drag, the thrust required\\nat low speeds will be reduced.\\nThe reduction in downwash at the horizontal tail will\\nreduce the effectiveness of the elevator. It may cause a\\npitch-down tendency, thus requiring greater up elevator\\nto trim the airplane.\\nIn the majority of cases, ground effect will cause an\\nincrease in pressure at the static source and produce a\\nlower indication of airspeed and altitude.\\nDuring the landing flare when the airplane is brought\\ninto ground effect at a constant angle of attack, the air-\\nplane will experience an increase in lift coefficient.\\nSpeed—Knots\\n Power Required—HP\\nL/D MAX\\nConstant\\nWeight\\nSea Level\\nAt Altitude\\nFigure 9-13.

However, as the airplane rises out of ground\\neffect with an insufficient airspeed, initial climb per-\\nformance may prove to be marginal because of the\\nincreased drag. Under extreme conditions such as high-\\ndensity altitude, high temperature, and maximum gross\\nweight, the airplane may be able to become airborne at\\nan insufficient airspeed, but unable to fly out of ground\\neffect. Consequently, the airplane may not be able to\\nclear an obstruction, or may settle back on the runway.\\nUnder marginal conditions, it is important the airplane\\ntakes off at the recommended speed that will provide\\nadequate initial climb performance. If the runway is\\nlong enough, or no obstacles exist, ground effect can be\\nused to an advantage by using the reduced drag to\\nimprove initial acceleration. Ground effect is important\\nto normal flight operations in the performance of soft\\nand rough field takeoffs and landings. The procedure\\nfor takeoff from these surfaces is to transfer as much\\nweight as possible to the wings during the ground run,\\nand to lift off with the aid of ground effect before true\\nflying speed is attained. It is then necessary to reduce\\nthe angle of attack gradually until normal airspeed is\\nattained before attempting to climb away from the\\nground effect.\\nREGION OF REVERSED COMMAND\\nThe aerodynamic properties of the airplane generally\\ndetermine the power requirements at various conditions\\nof flight, while the powerplant capabilities generally\\ndetermine the power available at various conditions of\\nflight. When the airplane is in steady, level flight, the\\ncondition of equilibrium must prevail. An unaccelerated\\ncondition of flight is achieved when lift equals weight,\\nand the powerplant is set for a thrust equal to the airplane\\ndrag. The power required to achieve equilibrium in con-\\nstant-altitude flight at various airspeeds is depicted on a\\npower required curve. The power required curve illus-\\ntrates the fact that at low airspeeds near the stall or mini-\\nmum controllable airspeed, the power setting required\\nfor steady, level flight is quite high.\\nFlight in the region of normal command means that\\nwhile holding a constant altitude, a higher airspeed\\nrequires a higher power setting and a lower airspeed\\nrequires a lower power setting. The majority of all air-\\nplane flying (climb, cruise, and maneuvers) is con-\\nducted in the region of normal command.\\nFlight in the region of reversed command means that\\na higher airspeed requires a lower power setting and a\\nlower airspeed requires a higher power setting to hold\\naltitude. It does not imply that a decrease in power will\\nproduce lower airspeed. The region of reversed com-\\nmand is encountered in the low speed phases of flight.\\nFlight speeds below the speed for maximum endurance\\n(lowest point on the power curve) require higher power\\nsettings with a decrease in airspeed. Since the need to\\nincrease the required power setting with decreased\\nspeed is contrary to the normal command of flight, the\\nregime of flight speeds between the speed for minimum\\nrequired power setting and the stall speed (or minimum\\ncontrol speed) is termed the region of reversed com-\\nmand. In the region of reversed command, a decrease\\nin airspeed must be accompanied by an increased\\npower setting in order to maintain steady flight.\\nFigure 9-15 shows the “maximum power available” as a\\ncurved line. Lower power settings, such as cruise power,\\nwould also appear in a similar curve. The lowest point\\non the power required curve represents the speed at\\nwhich the lowest brake horsepower will sustain level\\nflight. This is termed the best endurance airspeed.\\nAn airplane performing a low airspeed, high pitch\\nattitude power approach for a short-field landing is\\nan example of operating in the region of reversed\\ncommand. If an unacceptably high sink rate should\\ndevelop, it may be possible for the pilot to reduce or\\nstop the descent by applying power.

Typically, performance chart information assumes\\npaved, level, smooth, and dry runway surfaces. Since no\\ntwo runways are alike, the runway surface differs from\\none runway to another, as does the runway gradient or\\nslope. [Figure 9-16]\\nRunway surfaces vary widely from one airport to\\nanother. The runway surface encountered may be con-\\ncrete, asphalt, gravel, dirt, or grass. The runway surface\\nfor a specific airport is noted in the Airport/Facility\\nDirectory. Any surface that is not hard and smooth will\\nincrease the ground roll during takeoff. This is due to\\nthe inability of the tires to smoothly roll along the run-\\nway. Tires can sink into soft, grassy, or muddy run-\\nways. Potholes or other ruts in the pavement can be the\\ncause of poor tire movement along the runway.\\nObstructions such as mud, snow, or standing water\\nreduce the airplane’s acceleration down the runway.\\nAlthough muddy and wet surface conditions can reduce\\nfriction between the runway and the tires, they can also\\nact as obstructions and reduce the landing distance.\\n[Figure 9-17]\\nBraking effectiveness is another consideration when\\ndealing with various runway types. The condition of\\nthe surface affects the braking ability of the airplane.\\nFigure 9-16. Charts assume paved, level, dry runway conditions.\\nFigure 9-17.

This means that for every 100 feet of\\nrunway length, the runway height changes by 3 feet. A\\npositive gradient indicates that the runway height\\nincreases, and a negative gradient indicates that the\\nrunway decreases in height. An upsloping runway\\nimpedes acceleration and results in a longer ground run\\nduring takeoff. However, landing on an upsloping run-\\nway typically reduces the landing roll. A downsloping\\nrunway aids in acceleration on takeoff resulting in\\nshorter takeoff distances. The opposite is true when\\nlanding, as landing on a downsloping runway increases\\nlanding distances. Runway slope information is con-\\ntained in the Airport/Facility Directory. [Figure 9-18]\\nWATER ON THE RUNWAY AND DYNAMIC\\nHYDROPLANING\\nWater on the runways reduces the friction between\\nthe tires and the ground, and can reduce braking\\neffectiveness. The ability to brake can be completely\\nlost when the tires are hydroplaning because a layer\\nof water separates the tires from the runway surface.\\nThis is also true of braking effectiveness when\\nrunways are covered in ice.\\nWhen the runway is wet, the pilot may be confronted\\nwith dynamic hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning\\nis a condition in which the airplane tires ride on a thin\\nsheet of water rather than on the runway’s surface.\\nBecause hydroplaning wheels are not touching the runway,\\nbraking and directional control are almost nil.\\nTo help minimize dynamic hydroplaning, some\\nrunways are grooved to help drain off water; but\\nmost runways are not.\\nTire pressure is a factor in dynamic hydroplaning.\\nBy the simple formula in figure 9-19, the pilot can\\ncalculate the minimum speed, in knots, at which\\nhydroplaning will begin. In plain language, the mini-\\nmum hydroplaning speed is determined by multiplying\\nthe square root of the main gear tire pressure in pounds\\nper square inch (p.s.i.), by nine.

And once hydroplaning starts, it can\\ncontinue well below the minimum, initial hydroplaning\\nspeed.\\nOn wet runways, directional control can be maximized\\nby landing into the wind. Abrupt control inputs should\\nbe avoided. When the runway is wet, anticipate braking\\nproblems well before landing and be prepared for\\nhydroplaning. Opt for a suitable runway most aligned\\nwith the wind. Mechanical braking may be ineffective,\\nso aerodynamic braking should be used to its fullest\\nadvantage.\\nTAKEOFF AND LANDING\\nPERFORMANCE\\nThe majority of pilot-caused airplane accidents occur\\nduring the takeoff and landing phase of flight.\\nBecause of this fact, the pilot must be familiar with all\\nthe variables that influence the takeoff and landing\\nperformance of an airplane and must strive for exact-\\ning, professional procedures of operation during these\\nphases of flight.\\nTakeoff and landing performance is a condition of\\naccelerated and decelerated motion. For instance,\\nduring takeoff, the airplane starts at zero speed and\\naccelerates to the takeoff speed to become airborne.\\nDuring landing, the airplane touches down at the\\nlanding speed and decelerates to zero speed.\\nThe important factors of takeoff or landing performance\\nare as follows:\\n• The takeoff or landing speed which will\\ngenerally be a function of the stall speed or\\nminimum flying speed.\\n• The rate of acceleration and deceleration during\\nthe takeoff or landing roll. The acceleration and\\ndeceleration experienced by any object varies\\ndirectly with the imbalance of force and inversely\\nwith the mass of the object.\\n• The takeoff or landing roll distance is a function\\nof both acceleration/deceleration and speed.\\nTAKEOFF PERFORMANCE\\nThe minimum takeoff distance is of primary interest in\\nthe operation of any airplane because it defines the run-\\nway requirements. The minimum takeoff distance is\\nobtained by taking off at some minimum safe speed\\nthat allows sufficient margin above stall and provides\\nsatisfactory control and initial rate of climb. Generally,\\nthe lift-off speed is some fixed percentage of the stall\\nspeed or minimum control speed for the airplane in the\\ntakeoff configuration. As such, the lift-off will be\\naccomplished at some particular value of lift coeffi-\\ncient and angle of attack. Depending on the airplane\\ncharacteristics, the lift-off speed will be anywhere from\\n1.05 to 1.25 times the stall speed or minimum control\\nspeed.\\nTo obtain minimum takeoff distance at the specific\\nlift-off speed, the forces that act on the airplane must\\nprovide the maximum acceleration during the takeoff\\nroll. The various forces acting on the airplane may or\\nmay not be under the control of the pilot, and various\\nprocedures may be necessary in certain airplanes to\\nmaintain takeoff acceleration at the highest value.\\nThe powerplant thrust is the principal force to provide\\nthe acceleration and, for minimum takeoff distance, the\\noutput thrust should be at a maximum. Lift and drag\\nare produced as soon as the airplane has speed, and the\\nvalues of lift and drag depend on the angle of attack\\nand dynamic pressure.\\nIn addition to the important factors of proper pro-\\ncedures, many other variables affect the takeoff\\nperformance of an airplane. Any item that alters the\\ntakeoff speed or acceleration rate during the takeoff roll\\nwill affect the takeoff distance.\\nFor example, the effect of gross weight on takeoff dis-\\ntance is significant and proper consideration of this\\nitem must be made in predicting the airplane’s takeoff\\ndistance. Increased gross weight can be considered to\\nproduce a threefold effect on takeoff performance: \\n1. higher lift-off speed, \\n2. greater mass to accelerate, and \\n3. increased retarding force (drag and ground friction).\\nIf the gross weight increases, a greater speed is nec-\\nessary to produce the greater lift necessary to get the\\nairplane airborne at the takeoff lift coefficient. As an\\nexample of the effect of a change in gross weight, a\\n21 percent increase in takeoff weight will require a\\n10 percent increase in lift-off speed to support the\\ngreater weight.\\nA change in gross weight will change the net accelerat-\\ning force and change the mass that is being accelerated.\\nIf the airplane has a relatively high thrust-to-weight\\nratio, the change in the net accelerating force is slight\\nand the principal effect on acceleration is due to the\\nchange in mass.\\nThe takeoff distance will vary at least as the square of\\nthe gross weight. For example, a 10 percent increase in\\ntakeoff gross weight would cause: \\n• a 5 percent increase in takeoff velocity, \\n• at least a 9 percent decrease in rate of accelera-\\ntion, and \\n• at least a 21 percent increase in takeoff distance.\\nCh 09.qxd  10/24/03  7:23 AM  Page 9-15'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='9-16\\nFor the airplane with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, the\\nincrease in takeoff distance might be approximately 21\\nto 22 percent, but for the airplane with a relatively low\\nthrust-to-weight ratio, the increase in takeoff distance\\nwould be approximately 25 to 30 percent. Such a pow-\\nerful effect requires proper consideration of gross\\nweight in predicting takeoff distance.\\nThe effect of wind on takeoff distance is large, and\\nproper consideration also must be provided when pre-\\ndicting takeoff distance. The effect of a headwind is to\\nallow the airplane to reach the lift-off speed at a lower\\ngroundspeed while the effect of a tailwind is to require\\nthe airplane to achieve a greater groundspeed to attain\\nthe lift-off speed.\\nA headwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed will\\nreduce the takeoff distance approximately 19 percent.\\nHowever, a tailwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff air-\\nspeed will increase the takeoff distance approximately\\n21 percent. In the case where the headwind speed is 50\\npercent of the takeoff speed, the takeoff distance would\\nbe approximately 25 percent of the zero wind takeoff\\ndistance (75 percent reduction).\\nThe effect of wind on landing distance is identical to\\nthe effect on takeoff distance. Figure 9-20 illustrates\\nthe general effect of wind by the percent change in\\ntakeoff or landing distance as a function of the ratio of\\nwind velocity to takeoff or landing speed.\\nThe effect of proper takeoff speed is especially important when\\nrunway lengths and takeoff distances are critical. The takeoff\\nspeeds specified in the AFM/POH are generally the minimum\\nsafe speeds at which the airplane can become airborne. Any\\nattempt to take off below the recommended speed could mean\\nthat the airplane may stall, be difficult to control, or have a very\\nlow initial rate of climb. In some cases, an excessive angle of\\nattack may not allow the airplane to climb out of ground effect.\\nOn the other hand, an excessive airspeed at takeoff may\\nimprove the initial rate of climb and “feel” of the airplane, but\\nwill produce an undesirable increase in takeoff distance.\\nAssuming that the acceleration is essentially unaffected, the\\ntakeoff distance varies as the square of the takeoff velocity.\\nThus, 10 percent excess airspeed would increase the\\ntakeoff distance 21 percent. In most critical takeoff\\nconditions, such an increase in takeoff distance would\\nbe prohibitive, and the pilot must adhere to the recom-\\nmended takeoff speeds.\\nThe effect of pressure altitude and ambient temperature\\nis to define primarily the density altitude and its effect\\non takeoff performance. While subsequent corrections\\nare appropriate for the effect of temperature on certain\\nitems of powerplant performance, density altitude\\ndefines specific effects on takeoff performance. An\\nincrease in density altitude can produce a twofold\\neffect on takeoff performance: \\n1. greater takeoff speed and \\n2. decreased thrust and reduced net accelerating\\nforce.\\nIf an airplane of given weight and configuration is\\noperated at greater heights above standard sea level,\\nthe airplane will still require the same dynamic pres-\\nsure to become airborne at the takeoff lift coefficient.\\nThus, the airplane at altitude will take off at the same\\nindicated airspeed as at sea level, but because of the\\nreduced air density, the true airspeed will be greater.\\nThe effect of density altitude on powerplant thrust\\ndepends much on the type of powerplant. An increase in\\naltitude above standard sea level will bring an immedi-\\nate decrease in power output for the unsupercharged\\nreciprocating engine. However, an increase in altitude\\nabove standard sea level will not cause a decrease in\\npower output for the supercharged reciprocating engine\\nuntil the altitude exceeds the critical operating altitude.\\nFor those powerplants that experience a decay in thrust\\nwith an increase in altitude, the effect on the net acceler-\\nating force and acceleration rate can be approximated by\\nassuming a direct variation with density. Actually, this\\nassumed variation would closely approximate the effect\\non airplanes with high thrust-to-weight ratios.\\nProper accounting of pressure altitude (field elevation\\nis a poor substitute) and temperature is mandatory for\\naccurate prediction of takeoff roll distance.\\n80\\n70\\n60\\n50\\n40\\n30\\n20\\n10\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n4040\\n50\\n60\\n0.3 0.2 0.1\\n0.1 0.2 0.3\\nTailwind\\nHeadwind\\nPercent Decrease\\nin Takeoff or\\nLanding Distance\\nRatio of Wind Velocity\\nto Takeoff or Landing\\nSpeed\\nPercent Increase\\nin Takeoff or\\nLanding Distance\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\nFigure 9-20.

In all\\ncases, the pilot must make an accurate prediction of\\ntakeoff distance from the performance data of the\\nAFM/POH, regardless of the runway available, and\\nstrive for a polished, professional takeoff procedure.\\nIn the prediction of takeoff distance from the\\nAFM/POH data, the following primary considerations\\nmust be given:\\n• Pressure altitude and temperature—to define the\\neffect of density altitude on distance.\\n• Gross weight—a large effect on distance.\\n• Wind—a large effect due to the wind or wind\\ncomponent along the runway.\\n• Runway slope and condition—the effect of an\\nincline and the retarding effect of factors such as\\nsnow or ice.\\nLANDING PERFORMANCE\\nIn many cases, the landing distance of an airplane will\\ndefine the runway requirements for flying operations.\\nThe minimum landing distance is obtained by landing\\nat some minimum safe speed, which allows sufficient\\nmargin above stall and provides satisfactory control\\nand capability for a go-around. Generally, the landing\\nspeed is some fixed percentage of the stall speed or\\nminimum control speed for the airplane in the landing\\nconfiguration. As such, the landing will be accom-\\nplished at some particular value of lift coefficient and\\nangle of attack. The exact values will depend on the\\nairplane characteristics but, once defined, the values\\nare independent of weight, altitude, and wind.\\nTo obtain minimum landing distance at the specified\\nlanding speed, the forces that act on the airplane must\\nprovide maximum deceleration during the landing roll.\\nThe forces acting on the airplane during the landing roll\\nmay require various procedures to maintain landing\\ndeceleration at the peak value.\\nA distinction should be made between the procedures\\nfor minimum landing distance and an ordinary landing\\nroll with considerable excess runway available.\\nMinimum landing distance will be obtained by creating\\na continuous peak deceleration of the airplane; that is,\\nextensive use of the brakes for maximum deceleration.\\nOn the other hand, an ordinary landing roll with con-\\nsiderable excess runway may allow extensive use of\\naerodynamic drag to minimize wear and tear on the\\ntires and brakes. If aerodynamic drag is sufficient to\\ncause deceleration of the airplane, it can be used in def-\\nerence to the brakes in the early stages of the landing\\nroll; i.e., brakes and tires suffer from continuous hard\\nuse, but airplane aerodynamic drag is free and does not\\nwear out with use. The use of aerodynamic drag is\\napplicable only for deceleration to 60 or 70 percent of\\nthe touchdown speed. At speeds less than 60 to 70 per-\\ncent of the touchdown speed, aerodynamic drag is so\\nslight as to be of little use, and braking must be utilized\\nto produce continued deceleration of the airplane.\\nSince the objective during the landing roll is to deceler-\\nate, the powerplant thrust should be the smallest\\npossible positive value (or largest possible negative\\nvalue in the case of thrust reversers).\\nIn addition to the important factors of proper pro-\\ncedures, many other variables affect the landing\\nperformance. Any item that alters the landing speed\\nor deceleration rate during the landing roll will\\naffect the landing distance.\\nThe effect of gross weight on landing distance is one of\\nthe principal items determining the landing distance.\\nOne effect of an increased gross weight is that a greater\\nspeed will be required to support the airplane at the\\nlanding angle of attack and lift coefficient.\\nFor an example of the effect of a change in gross\\nweight, a 21 percent increase in landing weight will\\nrequire a 10 percent increase in landing speed to sup-\\nport the greater weight.\\nWhen minimum landing distances are considered,\\nbraking friction forces predominate during the landing\\nroll and, for the majority of airplane configurations,\\nbraking friction is the main source of deceleration.\\nThe minimum landing distance will vary in direct pro-\\nportion to the gross weight. For example, a 10 percent\\nincrease in gross weight at landing would cause a: \\n• 5 percent increase in landing velocity and \\n• 10 percent increase in landing distance.\\nA contingency of this is the relationship between\\nweight and braking friction force.\\nThe effect of wind on landing distance is large and\\ndeserves proper consideration when predicting landing\\ndistance. Since the airplane will land at a particular air-\\nspeed independent of the wind, the principal effect of\\nwind on landing distance is due to the change in the\\ngroundspeed at which the airplane touches down. The\\neffect of wind on deceleration during the landing is\\nidentical to the effect on acceleration during the take-\\noff.\\nA headwind that is 10 percent of the landing airspeed will\\nreduce the landing distance approximately 19 percent, but\\nCh 09.qxd  10/24/03  7:23 AM  Page 9-17'),\n",

An increase in density altitude will\\nincrease the landing speed but will not alter the net\\nretarding force. Thus, the airplane at altitude will land\\nat the same indicated airspeed as at sea level but,\\nbecause of the reduced density, the true airspeed (TAS)\\nwill be greater. Since the airplane lands at altitude with\\nthe same weight and dynamic pressure, the drag and\\nbraking friction throughout the landing roll have the\\nsame values as at sea level. As long as the condition is\\nwithin the capability of the brakes, the net retarding\\nforce is unchanged, and the deceleration is the same as\\nwith the landing at sea level. Since an increase in alti-\\ntude does not alter deceleration, the effect of density\\naltitude on landing distance would actually be due to\\nthe greater TAS.\\nThe minimum landing distance at 5,000 feet would be\\n16 percent greater than the minimum landing distance\\nat sea level. The approximate increase in landing dis-\\ntance with altitude is approximately 3 1/2 percent for\\neach 1,000 feet of altitude. Proper accounting of den-\\nsity altitude is necessary to accurately predict landing\\ndistance.\\nThe effect of proper landing speed is important when\\nrunway lengths and landing distances are critical. The\\nlanding speeds specified in the AFM/POH are gener-\\nally the minimum safe speeds at which the airplane can\\nbe landed. Any attempt to land at below the specified\\nspeed may mean that the airplane may stall, be difficult\\nto control, or develop high rates of descent. On the\\nother hand, an excessive speed at landing may improve\\nthe controllability slightly (especially in crosswinds),\\nbut will cause an undesirable increase in landing dis-\\ntance.\\nA 10 percent excess landing speed would cause at least\\na 21 percent increase in landing distance. The excess\\nspeed places a greater working load on the brakes\\nbecause of the additional kinetic energy to be dissi-\\npated. Also, the additional speed causes increased drag\\nand lift in the normal ground attitude, and the increased\\nlift will reduce the normal force on the braking sur-\\nfaces. The deceleration during this range of speed\\nimmediately after touchdown may suffer, and it will be\\nmore likely that a tire can be blown out from braking at\\nthis point.\\nThe most critical conditions of landing performance\\nare the result of some combination of high gross\\nweight, high density altitude, and unfavorable wind.\\nThese conditions produce the greatest landing distance\\nand provide critical levels of energy dissipation\\nrequired of the brakes. In all cases, it is necessary to\\nmake an accurate prediction of minimum landing\\ndistance to compare with the available runway. A pol-\\nished, professional landing procedure is necessary\\nbecause the landing phase of flight accounts for more\\npilot-caused airplane accidents than any other single\\nphase of flight.\\nIn the prediction of minimum landing distance from\\nthe AFM/POH data, the following considerations must\\nbe given:\\n• Pressure altitude and temperature—to define the\\neffect of density altitude.\\n• Gross weight—which defines the CAS for\\nlanding.\\n• Wind—a large effect due to wind or wind\\ncomponent along the runway.\\n• Runway slope and condition—relatively small\\ncorrection for ordinary values of runway slope,\\nbut a significant effect of snow, ice, or soft\\nground.\\nPERFORMANCE SPEEDS\\nTrue Airspeed (TAS) – the speed of the airplane in rela-\\ntion to the air mass in which it is flying.\\nIndicated Airspeed (IAS) – the speed of the airplane as\\nobserved on the airspeed indicator.

Engineers record the flight data and create\\nperformance charts based on the behavior of the\\nairplane during the test flights. By using these\\nperformance charts, a pilot can determine the\\nrunway length needed to take off and land, the\\namount of fuel that will be used during flight,\\nand the length of time it will take to arrive at the\\ndestination. It is important to remember that the\\ndata from the charts will not be accurate if the\\nairplane is not in good working order or when\\noperating under adverse conditions. So take into\\nconsideration that it is necessary to compensate\\nthe performance numbers if the airplane is not in\\ngood working order or piloting skills are below\\naverage.

Reading in\\nthe notes section under point number two, it says to\\ndecrease the distances by 10 percent for each 9 knots of\\nheadwind. With 18 knots of headwind, it is necessary to\\ndecrease the distance by 20 percent. Multiply 1,325 feet\\nby 20 percent or by .20 (1325 x .20 = 265), then subtract\\nthat amount from the total distance (1325 – 265 = 1060).\\nRepeat this process for the total distance over a 50-foot\\nobstacle. The ground roll distance is 1,060 feet and the\\ntotal distance over a 50-foot obstacle is 1,984 feet.\\nCLIMB AND CRUISE CHARTS\\nClimb and cruise chart information is based on actual\\nflight tests conducted in an airplane of the same type.\\nThis information is extremely useful when planning a\\ncross-country to predict the performance and fuel\\nconsumption of the airplane. Manufacturers produce\\nseveral different charts for climb and cruise perform-\\nance. These charts will include everything from fuel,\\ntime, and distance to climb, to best power setting\\nduring cruise, to cruise range performance.\\nThe first chart to check for climb performance is a fuel,\\ntime, and distance-to-climb chart. This chart will give\\nthe fuel amount used during the climb, the time it will\\ntake to accomplish the climb, and the ground distance\\nthat will be covered during the climb. To use this chart,\\nobtain the information for the departing airport and for\\nthe cruise altitude. Using figure 9-26, calculate the fuel,\\ntime, and distance to climb based on the information\\nprovided.\\nSample Problem 4\\nDeparting Airport Pressure Altitude..............6,000 feet\\nDeparting Airport OAT..........................................25°C\\nCruise Pressure Altitude..............................10,000 feet\\nCruise OAT............................................................10°C\\nFirst, find the information for the departing airport.\\nFind the OAT for the departing airport along the bot-\\ntom, left-hand side of the graph.

Like takeoff\\nperformance charts, landing distance information is\\navailable as normal landing information as well as\\nlanding distance over a 50-foot obstacle. As usual,\\nread the associated conditions and notes in order to\\nascertain the basis of the chart information.\\nRemember, when calculating landing distance that the\\nlanding weight will not be the same as the takeoff\\nweight.

The airworthiness certification standards of part 25\\nrequire proven levels of performance and guaranteed\\nsafety margins for these airplanes, regardless of the\\nspecific operating regulations under which they are\\nemployed.\\nMAJOR DIFFERENCES IN TRANSPORT\\nCATEGORY VERSUS NON-TRANSPORT\\nCATEGORY PERFORMANCE\\nREQUIREMENTS\\n• Full Temperature Accountability\\nAll of the performance charts for the transport\\ncategory airplanes require that takeoff and climb\\nperformance be computed with the full effects of\\ntemperature considered.\\n• Climb Performance Expressed as Percent\\nGradient of Climb\\nThe transport category airplane’s climb perform-\\nance is expressed as a percent gradient of climb\\nrather than a figure calculated in feet per minute\\nof climb. This percent gradient of climb is a much\\nmore practical expression of performance since it\\nis the airplane’s angle of climb that is critical in\\nan obstacle clearance situation.\\n• Change in Lift-off Technique\\nLift-off technique in transport category air-\\nplanes allows the reaching of V\\n2 (takeoff safety\\nspeed) after the airplane is airborne. This is\\npossible because of the excellent acceleration\\nand reliability characteristics of the engines on\\nthese airplanes and also because of the larger\\nsurplus of power.\\n• Performance Requirements Applicable to all\\nSegments of Aviation\\nAll airplanes certificated by the FAA in the\\ntransport category, whatever the size, must be\\noperated in accordance with the same perform-\\nance criteria. This applies to both commercial\\nand non-commercial operations.\\nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS\\nThe performance requirements that the transport cate-\\ngory airplane must meet are as follows:\\nTAKEOFF\\n• Takeoff speeds\\n• Takeoff runway required\\n• Takeoff climb required\\n• Obstacle clearance requirements\\nLANDING\\n• Landing speeds\\n• Landing runway required\\n• Landing climb required\\nTAKEOFF PLANNING\\nThe following are the speeds that affect the transport\\ncategory airplane’s takeoff performance. The flight\\ncrew must be thoroughly familiar with each of these\\nspeeds and how they are used in takeoff planning.\\nFigure 9-35. Stall speed table.\\nCh 09.qxd  10/24/03  7:23 AM  Page 9-31'),\n",

Accelerate-Go Distance\\nThe distance required to accelerate to V1 with all\\nengines at takeoff power, experience an engine\\nfailure at V\\n1 and continue the takeoff on the\\nremaining engine(s). The runway required\\nincludes the distance required to climb to 35 feet\\nby which time V\\n2 speed must be attained.\\n2. Accelerate-Stop Distance\\nThe distance required to accelerate to V\\n1 with all\\nengines at takeoff power, experience an engine\\nfailure at V\\n1, and abort the takeoff and bring the\\nairplane to a stop using braking action only (use\\nof thrust reversing is not considered).\\n3. Takeoff Distance\\nThe distance required to complete an all-engines\\noperative takeoff to the 35-foot height. It must be\\nat least 15 percent less than the distance required\\nfor a one-engine inoperative engine takeoff. This\\ndistance is not normally a limiting factor as it is\\nusually less than the one-engine inoperative take-\\noff distance.\\nThese three required takeoff runway considerations are\\nshown in figure 9-36.\\nBALANCED FIELD LENGTH\\nIn most cases, the pilot will be working with a per-\\nformance chart for takeoff runway required, which will\\ngive “balanced field length” information.

The sec-\\nond segment is the climb from the 35-foot height to 400\\nfeet above the ground. The climb is done at full takeoff\\npower on the operating engine(s), at V\\n2 speed, and with\\nthe flaps in the takeoff configuration. The required\\nclimb gradient in this segment is 2.4 percent for two-\\nengine airplanes, 2.7 percent for three-engine airplanes,\\nand 3.0 percent for four-engine airplanes.\\nTHIRD OR ACCELERATION SEGMENT\\nDuring this segment, the airplane is considered to be\\nmaintaining the 400 feet above the ground and acceler-\\nating from the V\\n2 speed to the V FS speed before the\\nclimb profile is continued. The flaps are raised at the\\nbeginning of the acceleration segment and power is\\nmaintained at the takeoff setting as long as possible\\n(5 minutes maximum).\\nFOURTH OR FINAL SEGMENT\\nThis segment is from the 400 to 1,500-foot AGL alti-\\ntude with power set at maximum continuous. The\\nrequired climb in this segment is a gradient of 1.2 per-\\ncent for two-engine airplanes, 1.55 for three-engine air-\\nplanes, and 1.7 percent for four-engine airplanes.\\nSECOND SEGMENT CLIMB LIMITATIONS\\nThe second segment climb requirements, from 35 to\\n400 feet, are the most restrictive (or hardest to meet) of\\nthe climb segments. The pilot must determine that the\\nsecond segment climb is met for each takeoff.

The net takeoff flightpath is the actual takeoff\\nflightpath reduced at each point by 0.8 percent for two-\\nengine airplanes, 0.9 percent for three-engine airplanes,\\nand 1.0 percent for four-engine airplanes.\\nAir carrier pilots therefore are responsible not only for\\ndetermining that there is enough runway available for\\nan engine inoperative takeoff (balanced field length),\\nand the ability to meet required climb gradients; but\\nthey must also assure that the airplane will be able to\\nsafely clear any obstacles that may be in the takeoff\\nflightpath.\\nThe net takeoff flightpath and obstacle clearance\\nrequired are shown in figure 9-39.\\nThe usual method of computing net takeoff flightpath\\nperformance is to add up the total ground distances\\nrequired for each of the climb segments and/or use\\nobstacle clearance performance charts in the AFM.\\nAlthough this obstacle clearance requirement is seldom\\na limitation at the normally used airports, it is quite\\noften an important consideration under critical condi-\\ntions such as high takeoff weight and/or high-density\\naltitude.

The required\\nclimb gradient can be affected by pressure altitude and\\ntemperature and, as in the second segment climb in the\\ntakeoff, airplane weight must be limited as needed in\\norder to comply with this climb requirement.\\nLANDING RUNWAY REQUIRED\\nThe runway distance needed for landing can be\\naffected by the following:\\n• Pressure altitude\\n• Temperature\\n• Headwind component\\n• Runway gradient or slope\\n• Airplane weight\\nIn computing the landing distance required, some man-\\nufacturers do not include all of the above items in their\\ncharts, since the regulations state that only pressure\\naltitude, wind, and airplane weight must be considered.\\nCharts are provided for anti-skid on and anti-skid off\\nconditions, but the use of reverse thrust is not used in\\ncomputing required landing distances.\\nThe landing distance, as required by the regulations, is\\nthat distance needed to land and come to a complete\\nstop from a point 50 feet above the threshold end of the\\nrunway.

However, as in the second segment\\nclimb requirement for takeoff, this approach climb\\ngradient must be met and landing weights must be\\nrestricted if necessary. The most likely conditions that\\nwould make the approach climb critical would be the\\nlandings at high weights and high-pressure altitudes\\nand temperatures, which might be encountered if a\\nlanding were required shortly after takeoff.\\nLanding field requirements can more frequently limit\\nan airplane’s allowable landing weight than the\\napproach climb limitations.

Nitrogen accounts for 78\\npercent of the gases that comprise the atmosphere,\\nwhile oxygen makes up 21 percent. Argon, carbon\\ndioxide, and traces of other gases make up the remain-\\ning 1 percent. [Figure 10-1]\\nWithin this envelope of gases, there are several \\nrecognizable layers of the atmosphere that are defined\\nnot only by altitude, but also by the specific \\ncharacteristics of that level. [Figure 10-2]\\nThe first layer, known as the troposphere , extends\\nfrom sea level up to 20,000 feet (8 km) over the \\nnorthern and southern poles and up to 48,000 feet (14.5\\nkm) over the equatorial regions.

Inside\\nthe troposphere, the temperature decreases at a rate of\\nabout 2° Celsius every 1,000 feet of altitude gain, and\\nthe pressure decreases at a rate of about 1 inch per\\n1,000 feet of altitude gain. At the top of the troposphere\\nis a boundary known as the tropopause , which traps\\nmoisture, and the associated weather, in the \\ntroposphere. The altitude of the tropopause varies with\\nlatitude and with the season of the year; therefore, it\\ntakes on an elliptical shape, as opposed to round.\\nLocation of the tropopause is important because it is\\ncommonly associated with the location of the \\njetstream and possible clear air turbulence.\\nThe atmospheric level above the tropopause is the\\nstratosphere, which extends from the tropopause to a\\nheight of about 160,000 feet (50 km). Little weather\\nexists in this layer and the air remains stable. At the top\\nof the stratosphere is another boundary known as the\\nstratopause, which exists at approximately 160,000\\nfeet. Directly above this is the mesosphere , which\\nextends to the mesopause boundary at about 280,000\\nfeet (85 km). The temperature in the mesosphere\\ndecreases rapidly with an increase in altitude and can\\nbe as cold as –90°C. The last layer of the atmosphere is\\nthe thermosphere. It starts above the mesosphere and\\ngradually fades into outer space.\\nOXYGEN AND THE HUMAN BODY\\nAs discussed earlier, nitrogen and other trace gases\\nmake up 79 percent of the atmosphere, while the\\nremaining 21 percent is life sustaining, atmospheric\\noxygen. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is great\\nenough to support normal growth, activity, and life. At\\n18,000 feet, however, the partial pressure of oxygen is\\nsignificantly reduced to the point that it adversely\\naffects the normal activities and functioning of the\\nhuman body. In fact, the reactions of the average \\nperson begin to be impaired at an altitude of about\\n10,000 feet and for some people as low as 5,000 feet.\\nThe physiological reactions to oxygen deprivation are\\ninsidious and affect people in different ways.

This\\nmeans a column of air 1-inch square, extending from\\nthe surface up to the upper atmospheric limit, weighs\\nabout 14.7 pounds. [Figure 10-3] A person standing at\\nsea level also experiences the pressure of the \\natmosphere; however, the pressure is not a downward\\nforce, but rather a force of pressure over the entire \\nsurface of the skin.\\nThe actual pressure at a given place and time will differ\\nwith altitude, temperature, and density of the air. These\\nconditions also affect aircraft performance, especially\\nwith regard to takeoff, rate of climb, and landings.\\nMEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\\nAtmospheric pressure is typically measured in inches\\nof mercury (in. Hg.) by a mercurial barometer. [Figure\\n10-4] The barometer measures the height of a column\\nof mercury inside a glass tube. A section of the mercury\\nis exposed to the pressure of the atmosphere, which\\nexerts a force on the mercury. An increase in pressure\\nforces the mercury to rise inside the tube; as pressure\\ndrops, mercury\\ndrains out of the tube, decreasing the\\nheight of the column. This type of barometer is \\ntypically used in a lab or weather observation station, is\\nnot easily transported, and is a bit difficult to read.\\nAn aneroid barometer is an alternative to a mercurial\\nbarometer; it is easier to read and transport. [Figure \\n10-5] The aneroid barometer contains a closed vessel,\\ncalled an aneroid cell, that contracts or expands with\\nchanges in pressure. The aneroid cell attaches to a \\npressure indicator with a mechanical linkage to provide\\npressure readings. The pressure sensing part of an \\naircraft altimeter is essentially an aneroid barometer. It\\nis important to note that due to the linkage mechanism\\nof an aneroid barometer, it is not as accurate as a \\nmercurial barometer.\\n14.7 lbs.\\nArea =1\\nSquare Inch\\nFigure 10-3.

These standard conditions are the\\nbasis for certain flight instruments and most airplane\\nperformance data. Standard sea level pressure is\\ndefined as 29.92 in. Hg. at 59 °F (15°C). Atmospheric\\npressure is also reported in millibars, with 1 inch of\\nmercury equaling approximately 34 millibars and \\nstandard sea level equaling 1013.2 millibars. Typical\\nmillibar pressure readings range from 950.0 to 1040.0\\nmillibars. Constant pressure charts and hurricane \\npressure reports are written using millibars.\\nSince weather stations are located around the globe, all\\nlocal barometric pressure readings are converted to a\\nsea level pressure to provide a standard for records and\\nreports. To achieve this, each station converts its \\nbarometric pressure by adding approximately 1 inch of\\nmercury for every 1,000 feet of elevation gain. For\\nexample, a station at 5,000 feet above sea level, with a\\nreading of 24.92 inches of mercury, reports a sea level\\npressure reading of 29.92 inches. [Figure 10-6] Using\\ncommon sea level pressure readings helps ensure \\naircraft altimeters are set correctly, based on the current\\npressure readings.\\nBy tracking barometric pressure trends across a large\\narea, weather forecasters can more accurately predict\\nmovement of pressure systems and the associated\\nweather. For example, tracking a pattern of rising \\npressure at a single weather station generally indicates\\nthe approach of fair weather. Conversely, decreasing or\\nrapidly falling pressure usually indicates approaching\\nbad weather and possibly, severe storms.\\nEFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON ATMOSPHERIC\\nPRESSURE\\nAs altitude increases, pressure diminishes, as the\\nweight of the air column decreases. On average, with\\nevery 1,000 feet of altitude increase, the atmospheric\\npressure decreases 1 inch of mercury. This decrease in\\npressure (increase in density altitude) has a pronounced\\neffect on aircraft performance.\\nEFFECT OF ALTITUDE ON FLIGHT\\nAltitude affects every aspect of flight from aircraft \\nperformance to human performance. At higher \\naltitudes, with a decreased atmospheric pressure, \\ntakeoff and landing distances are increased, as are\\nclimb rates.\\nWhen an aircraft takes off, lift must be developed by\\nthe flow of air around the wings. If the air is thin, more\\nspeed is required to obtain enough lift for takeoff;\\ntherefore, the ground run is longer. An aircraft that\\nrequires a 1,000-foot ground run at sea level will\\nrequire almost double that at an airport 5,000 feet\\nabove sea level [Figure 10-7]. It is also true that at\\nhigher altitudes, due to the decreased density of the air,\\naircraft engines and propellers are less efficient.

This, in turn, \\ncreates motion in the atmosphere, both vertically and\\nhorizontally, in the form of currents and wind. Motion\\nin the atmosphere, combined with moisture, produces\\nclouds and precipitation otherwise known as weather.\\nWIND\\nPressure and temperature changes produce two kinds\\nof motion in the atmosphere—vertical movement of\\nascending and descending currents, and horizontal\\nmovement in the form of wind. Both types of motion in\\nthe atmosphere are important as they affect the takeoff,\\nlanding, and cruise flight operations. More \\nimportant, however, is that these motions in the \\natmosphere, otherwise called atmospheric circulation,\\ncause weather changes.\\nTHE CAUSE OF ATMOSPHERIC \\nCIRCULATION\\nAtmospheric circulation is the movement of air around\\nthe surface of the Earth. It is caused by uneven heating\\nof the Earth’s surface and upsets the equilibrium of the\\natmosphere, creating changes in air movement and\\natmospheric pressure. Because the Earth has a curved\\nsurface that rotates on a tilted axis while orbiting the\\nsun, the equatorial regions of the Earth receive a greater\\namount of heat from the sun than the polar regions. The\\namount of sun that heats the Earth depends upon the\\ntime of day, time of year, and the latitude of the specific\\nregion. All of these factors affect the length of time and\\nthe angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.\\nIn general circulation theory, areas of low pressure\\nexist over the equatorial regions, and areas of high\\npressure exist over the polar regions due to a difference\\nin temperature. Solar heating causes air to become less\\ndense and rise in equatorial areas. The resulting low\\npressure allows the high-pressure air at the poles to\\nflow along the planet’s surface toward the equator. As\\nthe warm air flows toward the poles, it cools, becoming\\nmore dense, and sinks back toward the surface. [Figure\\n10-8] This pattern of air circulation is correct in theory;\\nhowever, the circulation of air is modified by several\\nforces, most importantly the rotation of the Earth.\\nThe force created by the rotation of the Earth is known\\nas Coriolis force. This force is not perceptible to us as\\nwe walk around because we move so slowly and travel\\nrelatively short distances compared to the size and \\nrotation rate of the Earth.

The Coriolis force deflects\\nair to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing it\\nto follow a curved path instead of a straight line. The\\namount of deflection differs depending on the latitude.\\nIt is greatest at the poles, and diminishes to zero at the\\nequator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs\\nwith the speed of the moving body—the faster the\\nspeed, the greater the deviation. In the Northern\\nHemisphere, the rotation of the Earth deflects moving\\nair to the right and changes the general circulation \\npattern of the air.\\nThe speed of the Earth’s rotation causes the general\\nflow to break up into three distinct cells in each \\nhemisphere. [Figure 10-9] In the Northern Hemisphere,\\nthe warm air at the equator rises upward from the \\nsurface, travels northward, and is deflected eastward\\nby the rotation of the Earth. By the time it has traveled\\none-third of the distance from the equator to the North\\nPole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward.\\nThis air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at about 30 °\\nlatitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks\\ntoward the surface. Then it flows southward along the\\nsurface back toward the equator. Coriolis force bends\\nthe flow to the right, thus creating the northeasterly\\ntrade winds that prevail from 30 ° latitude to the \\nequator. Similar forces create circulation cells that\\nencircle the Earth between 30 ° and 60° latitude, and\\nbetween 60 ° and the poles. This circulation pattern\\nresults in the prevailing westerly winds in the \\nconterminous United States.\\nCirculation patterns are further complicated by \\nseasonal changes, differences between the surfaces of\\ncontinents and oceans, and other factors.\\nFrictional forces caused by the topography of the\\nEarth’s surface modify the movement of the air in the\\natmosphere. Within 2,000 feet of the ground, the \\nfriction between the surface and the atmosphere slows\\nthe moving air. The wind is diverted from its path\\nbecause the frictional force reduces the Coriolis force.\\nThis is why the wind direction at the surface varies\\nsomewhat from the wind direction just a few thousand\\nfeet above the Earth.\\nWIND PATTERNS\\nAir flows from areas of high pressure into those of low\\npressure because air always seeks out lower pressure.\\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, this flow of air from areas\\nof high to low pressure is deflected to the right; \\nproducing a clockwise circulation around an area of\\nhigh pressure. This is also known as anti-cyclonic \\ncirculation. The opposite is true of low-pressure areas;\\nthe air flows toward a low and is deflected to create a\\ncounter-clockwise or cyclonic circulation. [Figure \\n10-10]\\nHigh-pressure systems are generally areas of dry, \\nstable, descending air. Good weather is typically \\nassociated with high-pressure systems for this reason.\\nConversely, air flows into a low-pressure area to\\nreplace rising air. This air tends to be unstable, and \\nusually brings increasing cloudiness and precipitation.\\nThus, bad weather is commonly associated with areas\\nof low pressure.\\nA good understanding of high- and low-pressure wind\\npatterns can be of great help when planning a flight,\\nbecause a pilot can take advantage of beneficial \\ntailwinds.

An added\\nadvantage is a better understanding of what type of\\nweather to expect in a given area along a route of flight\\nbased on the prevailing areas of highs and lows.\\nThe theory of circulation and wind patterns is accurate\\nfor large-scale atmospheric circulation; however, it\\ndoes not take into account changes to the circulation on\\na local scale. Local conditions, geological features, and\\nother anomalies can change the wind direction and\\nspeed close to the Earth’s surface.\\nCONVECTIVE CURRENTS\\nDifferent surfaces radiate heat in varying amounts.\\nPlowed ground, rocks, sand, and barren land give off a\\nlarge amount of heat; water, trees, and other areas of\\nvegetation tend to absorb and retain heat. The resulting\\nuneven heating of the air creates small areas of local\\ncirculation called convective currents.\\nConvective currents cause the bumpy, turbulent air\\nsometimes experienced when flying at lower altitudes\\nduring warmer weather. On a low altitude flight over\\nvarying surfaces, updrafts are likely to occur over \\npavement or barren places, and downdrafts often occur\\nover water or expansive areas of vegetation like a\\ngroup of trees. Typically, these turbulent conditions can\\nbe avoided by flying at higher altitudes, even above\\ncumulus cloud layers. [Figure 10-12]\\nConvective currents are particularly noticeable in areas\\nwith a landmass directly adjacent to a large body of\\nwater, such as an ocean, large lake, or other appreciable\\narea of water. During the day, land heats faster than\\nwater, so the air over the land becomes warmer and less\\ndense. It rises and is replaced by cooler, denser air\\nflowing in from over the water. This causes an onshore\\nwind, called a sea breeze .  Conversely, at night land\\ncools faster than water, as does the corresponding air.\\nIn this case, the warmer air over the water rises and is\\nreplaced by the cooler, denser air from the land,\\ncreating an offshore wind called a land breeze . This\\nreverses the local wind circulation pattern. Convective\\ncurrents can occur anywhere there is an uneven heating\\nof the Earth’s surface. [Figure 10-13]\\nHigh\\nLow\\nFigure 10-10.

During the landing phase\\nof flight, an aircraft may “drop in” due to the turbulent\\nair and be too low to clear obstacles during the\\napproach.\\nThis same condition is even more noticeable when \\nflying in mountainous regions. [Figure 10-16] While\\nthe wind flows smoothly up the windward side of the\\nmountain and the upward currents help to carry an \\naircraft over the peak of the mountain, the wind on the\\nleeward side does not act in a similar manner. As the air\\nflows down the leeward side of the mountain, the air\\nfollows the contour of the terrain and is increasingly\\nturbulent. This tends to push an aircraft into the side of\\na mountain. The stronger the wind, the greater the\\ndownward pressure and turbulence become.\\nDue to the effect terrain has on the wind in valleys or\\ncanyons, downdrafts can be severe. Thus, a prudent\\npilot is well advised to seek out a mountain qualified\\nflight instructor and get a mountain checkout before\\nconducting a flight in or near mountainous terrain.\\nLOW-LEVEL WIND SHEAR\\nWind shear is a sudden, drastic change in windspeed\\nand/or direction over a very small area. Wind shear can\\nsubject an aircraft to violent updrafts and downdrafts\\nas well as abrupt changes to the horizontal movement\\nof the aircraft. While wind shear can occur at any \\naltitude, low-level wind shear is especially hazardous\\ndue to the proximity of an aircraft to the ground.\\nDirectional wind changes of 180°and speed changes of\\n50 knots or more are associated with low-level wind\\nshear. Low-level wind shear is commonly associated\\nwith passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, and \\ntemperature inversions with strong upper level winds\\n(greater than 25 knots).\\nWind shear is dangerous to an aircraft for several \\nreasons. The rapid changes in wind direction and \\nvelocity changes the wind’s relation to the aircraft \\ndisrupting the normal flight attitude and performance\\nof the aircraft. During a wind shear situation, the effects\\ncan be subtle or very dramatic depending on windspeed\\nand direction of change. For example, a tailwind that\\nquickly changes to a headwind will cause an increase\\nin airspeed and performance. Conversely, when a \\nheadwind changes to a tailwind, the airspeed will \\nrapidly decrease and there will be a corresponding\\ndecrease in performance. In either case, a pilot must be\\nprepared to react immediately to the changes to \\nmaintain control of the aircraft.\\nFigure 10-14.

In an effort to warn\\npilots of low-level wind shear, alert systems have been\\ninstalled at several airports around the country. A series\\nof anemometers, placed around the airport, form a net\\nto detect changes in windspeeds. When windspeeds\\ndiffer by more than 15 knots, a warning for wind shear\\nis given to pilots. This system is known as the low-level\\nwind shear alert system, or LLWAS.\\nIt is important to remember that wind shear can affect\\nany flight and any pilot at any altitude. While wind\\nshear may be reported, it often remains undetected and\\nis a silent danger to aviation. Always be alert to the \\npossibility of wind shear, especially when flying in and\\naround thunderstorms and frontal systems.\\nWIND AND PRESSURE REPRESENTATION\\nON SURFACE WEATHER MAPS\\nSurface weather maps provide information about\\nfronts, areas of high and low pressure, and surface\\nwinds and pressures for each station. This type of\\nweather map allows pilots to see the locations of fronts\\nand pressure systems, but more importantly, it depicts\\nthe wind and pressure at the surface for each location.\\nFor more information on surface analysis and weather\\ndepiction charts see Chapter 11.\\nWind conditions are reported by an arrow attached to\\nthe station location circle. [Figure 10-18] The station\\ncircle represents the head of the arrow, with the arrow\\npointing in the direction from which the wind is \\nblowing. Winds are described by the direction from\\nwhich they blow, thus a northwest wind means that the\\nwind is blowing from the northwest toward the \\nsoutheast. The speed of the wind is depicted by barbs\\nor pennants placed on the wind line. Each barb \\nrepresents a speed of 10 knots, while half a barb is\\nequal to 5 knots and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.\\nThe pressure for each station is recorded on the weather\\nchart and is shown in millibars. Isobars are lines drawn\\non the chart to depict areas of equal pressure. These\\nlines result in a pattern that reveals the pressure \\ngradient or change in pressure over distance. [Figure\\n10-19] Isobars are similar to contour lines on a \\ntopographic map that indicate terrain altitudes and\\nslope steepness. For example, isobars that are closely\\nspaced indicate a steep wind gradient and strong winds\\nprevail. Shallow gradients, on the other hand, are \\nrepresented by isobars that are spaced far apart, and are\\nindicative of light winds. Isobars help identify low- and\\nhigh-pressure systems as well as the location of ridges,\\ntroughs, and cols.

A ridge is an\\nelongated area of high pressure, and a trough is an \\nelongated area of low pressure. A col is the intersection\\nbetween a ridge and a trough, or an area of neutrality\\nbetween two highs or two lows.\\nIsobars furnish valuable information about winds in the\\nfirst few thousand feet above the surface. Close to the\\nground, wind direction is modified by the surface and\\nwindspeed decreases due to friction with the \\nsurface. At levels 2,000 to 3,000 feet above the \\nsurface, however, the speed is greater and the direction\\nbecomes more parallel to the isobars. Therefore, the\\nsurface winds are shown on the weather map as well as\\nthe winds at a slightly higher altitude.\\nGenerally, the wind 2,000 feet above the ground will be\\n20° to 40° to the right of surface winds, and the wind-\\nspeed will be greater. The change of wind direction is\\ngreatest over rough terrain and least over flat surfaces,\\nsuch as open water. In the absence of winds aloft \\ninformation, this rule of thumb allows for a rough \\nestimate of the wind conditions a few thousand feet\\nabove the surface.\\nATMOSPHERIC STABILITY\\nThe stability of the atmosphere depends on its ability to\\nresist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes \\nvertical movement difficult, and small vertical \\ndisturbances dampen out and disappear. In an unstable\\natmosphere, small vertical air movements tend to\\nbecome larger, resulting in turbulent airflow and \\nconvective activity. Instability can lead to significant\\nturbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe\\nweather. \\nRising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air\\npressure as altitude increases. The opposite is true of\\ndescending air; as atmospheric pressure increases, the\\ntemperature of descending air increases as it is \\ncompressed. Adiabatic heating, or adiabatic cooling,\\nare the terms used to describe this temperature change. \\nThe adiabatic process takes place in all upward and\\ndownward moving air. When air rises into an area of\\nlower pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the\\nmolecules of air expand, the temperature of the air \\nlowers. As a result, when a parcel of air rises, pressure\\ndecreases, volume increases, and temperature\\ndecreases. When air descends, the opposite is true. The\\nrate at which temperature decreases with an increase in\\naltitude is referred to as its lapse rate. As air ascends\\nthrough the atmosphere, the average rate of \\ntemperature change is 2°C (3.5°F) per 1,000 feet. \\nSince water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases\\nair density, causing it to rise. Conversely, as moisture\\ndecreases, air becomes denser and tends to sink. Since\\nmoist air cools at a slower rate, it is generally less sta-\\nble than dry air since the moist air must rise higher\\nbefore its temperature cools to that of the surrounding\\nair. The dry adiabatic lapse rate (unsaturated air) is 3°C\\n(5.4°F) per 1,000 feet. The moist adiabatic lapse rate\\nvaries from 1.1°C to 2.8°C (2°F to 5°F) per 1,000 feet. \\nThe combination of moisture and temperature \\ndetermine the stability of the air and the resulting\\nweather. Cool, dry air is very stable and resists vertical\\nmovement, which leads to good and generally clear\\nweather. The greatest instability occurs when the air is\\nmoist and warm, as it is in the tropical regions in the\\nsummer. Typically, thunderstorms appear on a daily\\nbasis in these regions due to the instability of the \\nsurrounding air.\\nIsobars\\nClosely spaced isobars mean\\na steep pressure gradient and\\nstrong winds.\\n552\\n558\\n564\\n570\\n576\\n582\\nWidely spaced isobars\\nmean a shallow pressure\\ngradient and relatively\\nlight winds.\\nFigure 10-19.

There is an atmospheric \\nanomaly that can occur, however, that changes this \\ntypical pattern of atmospheric behavior. When the \\ntemperature of the air rises with altitude, a temperature\\ninversion exists. Inversion layers are commonly \\nshallow layers of smooth, stable air close to the ground.\\nThe temperature of the air increases with altitude to a\\ncertain point, which is the top of the inversion. The air\\nat the top of the layer acts as a lid, keeping weather and\\npollutants trapped below. If the relative humidity of the\\nair is high, it can contribute to the formation of clouds,\\nfog, haze, or smoke, resulting in diminished visibility\\nin the inversion layer.\\nSurface based temperature inversions occur on clear,\\ncool nights when the air close to the ground is cooled\\nby the lowering temperature of the ground. The air\\nwithin a few hundred feet of the surface becomes\\ncooler than the air above it. Frontal inversions occur\\nwhen warm air spreads over a layer of cooler air, or\\ncooler air is forced under a layer of warmer air.\\nMOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE\\nThe atmosphere, by nature, contains moisture in the\\nform of water vapor. The amount of moisture present in\\nthe atmosphere is dependent upon the temperature of\\nthe air. Every 20°F increase in temperature doubles the\\namount of moisture the air can hold. Conversely, a\\ndecrease of 20°F cuts the capacity in half.\\nWater is present in the atmosphere in three states: \\nliquid, solid, and gaseous. All three forms can readily\\nchange to another, and all are present within the \\ntemperature ranges of the atmosphere. As water\\nchanges from one state to another, an exchange of heat\\ntakes place. These changes occur through the processes\\nof evaporation , sublimation , condensation ,\\ndeposition, melting, or freezing. However, water vapor\\nis added into the atmosphere only by the processes of\\nevaporation and sublimation.\\nEvaporation is the changing of liquid water to water\\nvapor. As water vapor forms, it absorbs heat from the\\nnearest available source. This heat exchange is known\\nas the latent heat of evaporation. A good example of\\nthis is when the body’s perspiration evaporates. The net\\neffect is a cooling sensation as heat is extracted from\\nthe body. Similarly, sublimation is the changing of ice\\ndirectly to water vapor, completely bypassing the \\nliquid stage. Though dry ice is not made of water, but\\nrather carbon dioxide, it demonstrates the principle of\\nsublimation, when a solid turns directly into vapor.\\nRELATIVE HUMIDITY\\nHumidity refers to the amount of water vapor present\\nin the atmosphere at a given time. Relative humidity is\\nthe actual amount of moisture in the air compared to\\nthe total amount of moisture the air could hold at that\\ntemperature. For example, if the current relative\\nhumidity is 65 percent, the air is holding 65 percent of\\nthe total amount of moisture that it is capable of \\nholding at that temperature and pressure. While much\\nof the western United States rarely sees days of high\\nhumidity, relative humidity readings of 75 to 90 \\npercent are not uncommon in the southern United\\nStates during warmer months. [Figure 10-20]\\nTEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT RELATIONSHIP\\nThe relationship between dewpoint and temperature\\ndefines the concept of relative humidity. The dewpoint,\\ngiven in degrees, is the temperature at which the air can\\nhold no more moisture. When the temperature of the\\nair is reduced to the dewpoint, the air is completely \\nsaturated and moisture begins to condense out of the\\nair in the form of fog, dew, frost, clouds, rain, hail, or\\nsnow.\\nAs moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the\\naltitude where temperature and dewpoint reach the\\nsame value. When lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate\\nof 5.4°F per 1,000 feet and the dewpoint temperature\\ndecreases at a rate of 1°F per 1,000 feet. This results in\\na convergence of temperature and dewpoint at a rate of\\n4.4°F. Apply the convergence rate to the reported \\ntemperature and dewpoint to determine the height of\\nthe cloud base.\\nGiven:\\nTemperature (T) = 85°F\\nDewpoint (DP) = 71°F\\nConvergence Rate (CR) = 4.4°\\nT – DP = Temperature Dewpoint Spread (TDS)\\nTDS ÷CR = X \\nX ×1,000 feet = height of cloud base AGL\\nExample:\\n85ºF – 71ºF = 14ºF\\n14ºF ÷4.4°F = 3.18\\n3.18 ×1,000 = 3,180 feet AGL\\nThe height of the cloud base is 3,180 feet AGL.\\nInversion—An increase in temperature with altitude.\\nEvaporation—The transformation of a liquid to a gaseous state, such as\\nthe change of water to water vapor.\\nSublimation\\uf8e7Process by which a solid is changed to a gas without going\\nthrough the liquid state.\\nCondensation\\uf8e7A change of state of water from a gas (water vapor) to a\\nliquid.\\nDeposition\\uf8e7The direct transformation of a gas to a solid state, in which\\nthe liquid state is bypassed.

Divide the temperature dewpoint spread by the\\nconvergence rate of 4.4 °F, and multiply by 1,000 to\\ndetermine the approximate height of the cloud base.\\nMETHODS BY WHICH AIR REACHES THE\\nSATURATION POINT\\nIf air reaches the saturation point while temperature\\nand dewpoint are close together, it is highly likely that\\nfog, low clouds, and precipitation will form. There are\\nfour methods by which air can reach the complete \\nsaturation point. First, when warm air moves over a\\ncold surface, the air’s temperature drops and reaches\\nthe saturation point. Second, the saturation point may\\nbe reached when cold air and warm air mix. Third,\\nwhen air cools at night through contact with the cooler\\nground, air reaches its saturation point. The fourth\\nmethod occurs when air is lifted or is forced upward in\\nthe atmosphere.\\nAs air rises, it uses heat energy to expand. As a result,\\nthe rising air loses heat rapidly. Unsaturated air loses\\nheat at a rate of 3.0 °C (5.4°F) for every 1,000 feet of\\naltitude gain. No matter what causes the air to reach its\\nsaturation point, saturated air brings clouds, rain, and\\nother critical weather situations.\\nDEW AND FROST\\nOn cool, calm nights, the temperature of the ground\\nand objects on the surface can cause temperatures of\\nthe surrounding air to drop below the dewpoint. When\\nthis occurs, the moisture in the air condenses and\\ndeposits itself on the ground, buildings, and other\\nobjects like cars and aircraft. This moisture is known as\\ndew and sometimes can be seen on grass in the \\nmorning. If the temperature is below freezing, the\\nmoisture will be deposited in the form of frost. While\\ndew poses no threat to an aircraft, frost poses a definite\\nflight safety hazard. Frost disrupts the flow of air over\\nthe wing and can drastically reduce the production of\\nlift. It also increases drag, which, when combined with\\nlowered lift production, can eliminate the ability to take\\noff. An aircraft must be thoroughly cleaned and free of\\nfrost prior to beginning a flight.\\nFOG\\nFog, by definition, is a cloud that begins within 50 feet\\nof the surface. It typically occurs when the temperature\\nof air near the ground is cooled to the air’s dewpoint.\\nA cubic meter of air with 17g of water vapor\\nat 20°C is at saturation, or 100% relative\\nhumidity. Any further cooling will cause\\ncondensation (fog, clouds, dew) to form.\\nThus, 20°C is the dewpoint for this situation.\\nIf the temperature is lowered\\nto 10°C, the air can only hold\\n9g of water vapor, and 8g of\\nwater will condense as water\\ndroplets. The relative humidity\\nwill still be at 100%.\\nIf the same cubic meter of air warms\\nto 30°C, the 17g of water vapor will \\nproduce a relative humidity of 56%.\\n(17g is 56% of the 30g the air could \\nhold at this temperature.)\\nC\\nC\\nC\\nFigure 10-20.

Fog is classified\\naccording to the manner in which it forms and is\\ndependent upon the current temperature and the\\namount of water vapor in the air.\\nOn clear nights, with relatively little to no wind \\npresent, radiation fog may develop. [Figure 10-21]\\nUsually, it forms in low-lying areas like mountain \\nvalleys. This type of fog occurs when the ground cools\\nrapidly due to terrestrial radiation, and the surrounding\\nair temperature reaches its dewpoint. As the sun rises\\nand the temperature increases, radiation fog will lift\\nand eventually burn off. Any increase in wind will also\\nspeed the dissipation of radiation fog. If radiation fog is\\nless than 20 feet thick, it is known as ground fog.\\nWhen a layer of warm, moist air moves over a cold \\nsurface, advection fog is likely to occur. Unlike \\nradiation fog, wind is required to form advection fog.\\nWinds of up to 15 knots allow the fog to form and\\nintensify; above a speed of 15 knots, the fog usually\\nlifts and forms low stratus clouds. Advection fog is\\ncommon in coastal areas where sea breezes can blow\\nthe air over cooler landmasses.\\nIn these same coastal areas, upslope fog is likely as\\nwell. Upslope fog occurs when moist, stable air is\\nforced up sloping land features like a mountain range.\\nThis type of fog also requires wind for formation and\\ncontinued existence. Upslope and advection fog, unlike\\nradiation fog, may not burn off with the morning sun,\\nbut instead can persist for days. They also can extend\\nto greater heights than radiation fog.\\nSteam fog, or sea smoke, forms when cold, dry air\\nmoves over warm water. As the water evaporates, it\\nrises and resembles smoke. This type of fog is common\\nover bodies of water during the coldest times of the\\nyear. Low-level turbulence and icing are commonly\\nassociated with steam fog.\\nIce fog occurs in cold weather when the temperature is\\nmuch below freezing and water vapor forms directly\\ninto ice crystals. Conditions favorable for its formation\\nare the same as for radiation fog except for cold \\ntemperature, usually –25°F or colder. It occurs mostly\\nin the arctic regions, but is not unknown in middle \\nlatitudes during the cold season.\\nCLOUDS\\nClouds are visible indicators and are often indicative of\\nfuture weather. For clouds to form, there must be \\nadequate water vapor and condensation nuclei, as well\\nas a method by which the air can be cooled. When the\\nair cools and reaches its saturation point, the invisible\\nwater vapor changes into a visible state. Through the\\nprocesses of deposition (also referred to as \\nsublimation) and condensation, moisture condenses or\\nsublimates onto miniscule particles of matter like dust,\\nsalt, and smoke known as condensation nuclei . The\\nnuclei are important because they provide a means for\\nthe moisture to change from one state to another.\\nCloud type is determined by its height, shape, and\\nbehavior. They are classified according to the height of\\ntheir bases as low, middle, or high clouds, as well as\\nclouds with vertical development. [Figure 10-22]\\nLow clouds are those that form near the Earth’s surface\\nand extend up to 6,500 feet AGL. They are made \\nprimarily of water droplets, but can include \\nsupercooled water droplets that induce hazardous \\naircraft icing. Typical low clouds are stratus, \\nstratocumulus, and nimbostratus. Fog is also classified\\nas a type of low cloud formation. Clouds in this family\\ncreate low ceilings, hamper visibility, and can change\\nrapidly. Because of this, they influence flight planning\\nand can make VFR flight impossible.\\nMiddle clouds form around 6,500 feet AGL and extend\\nup to 20,000 feet AGL. They are composed of water,\\nice crystals, and supercooled water droplets. Typical\\nmiddle-level clouds include altostratus and \\naltocumulus. These types of clouds may be \\nencountered on cross-country flights at higher \\naltitudes. Altostratus clouds can produce turbulence\\nand may contain moderate icing.

The bases of these\\nclouds form in the low to middle cloud base region but\\ncan extend into high altitude cloud levels. Towering \\ncumulus clouds indicate areas of instability in the\\natmosphere, and the air around and inside them is \\nturbulent. These types of clouds often develop\\ninto cumulonimbus clouds or thunderstorms.\\nCumulonimbus clouds contain large amounts of \\nmoisture and unstable air, and usually produce \\nhazardous weather phenomena such as lightning, hail,\\ntornadoes, gusty winds, and wind shear.

Cumulonimbus clouds that\\nform in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands of \\nthunderstorms or squall lines.\\nSince rising air currents cause cumulonimbus clouds,\\nthey are extremely turbulent and pose a significant \\nhazard to flight safety. For example, if an aircraft enters\\na thunderstorm, the aircraft could experience updrafts\\nand downdrafts that exceed 3,000 feet per minute. In\\naddition, thunderstorms can produce large hailstones,\\ndamaging lightning, tornadoes, and large quantities of\\nwater, all of which are potentially hazardous to aircraft.\\nA thunderstorm makes its way through three distinct\\nstages before dissipating. It begins with the cumulus\\nstage, in which lifting action of the air begins. If \\nsufficient moisture and instability are present, the\\nclouds continue to increase in vertical height.\\nContinuous, strong updrafts prohibit moisture from\\nfalling. The updraft region grows larger than the \\nindividual thermals feeding the storm. Within \\napproximately 15 minutes, the thunderstorm reaches\\nthe mature stage, which is the most violent time period\\nof the thunderstorm’s life cycle. At this point, drops of\\nmoisture, whether rain or ice, are too heavy for the\\ncloud to support and begin falling in the form of rain or\\nhail. This creates a downward motion of the air. Warm,\\nrising air; cool, precipitation-induced descending air;\\nand violent turbulence all exist within and near the\\ncloud. Below the cloud, the down-rushing air increases\\nsurface winds and decreases the temperature. Once the\\nvertical motion near the top of the cloud slows down,\\nthe top of the cloud spreads out and takes on an \\nanvil-like shape. At this point, the storm enters the \\ndissipating stage. This is when the downdrafts spread\\nout and replace the updrafts needed to sustain the\\nstorm. [Figure 10-23]\\nIt is impossible to fly over thunderstorms in light \\naircraft. Severe thunderstorms can punch through the\\ntropopause and reach staggering heights of 50,000 to\\n60,000 feet depending on latitude. Flying under \\nthunderstorms can subject aircraft to rain, hail, \\ndamaging lightning, and violent turbulence. A good\\nrule of thumb is to circumnavigate thunderstorms by at\\nleast 5 nautical miles (NM) since hail may fall for miles\\noutside of the clouds.

Visibility refers to the greatest\\nhorizontal distance at which prominent objects can be\\nviewed with the naked eye. Current visibility is also\\nreported in METAR and other aviation weather reports,\\nas well as automated weather stations. Visibility \\ninformation, as predicted by meteorologists, is \\navailable during a preflight weather briefing.\\nPRECIPITATION\\nPrecipitation refers to any form of water particles that\\nform in the atmosphere and fall to the ground. It has a\\nprofound impact on flight safety. Depending on the\\nform of precipitation, it can reduce visibility, create\\nicing situations, and affect landing and takeoff \\nperformance of an aircraft.\\nPrecipitation occurs because water or ice particles in\\nclouds grow in size until the atmosphere can no longer\\nsupport them. It can occur in several forms as it falls\\ntoward the Earth, including drizzle, rain, ice pellets,\\nhail, and ice. \\nDrizzle is classified as very small water droplets,\\nsmaller than 0.02 inches in diameter. Drizzle usually\\naccompanies fog or low stratus clouds. Water droplets\\nof larger size are referred to as rain. Rain that falls\\nthrough the atmosphere but evaporates prior to striking\\nthe ground is known as virga. Freezing rain and \\nfreezing drizzle occur when the temperature of the \\nsurface is below freezing; the rain freezes on contact\\nwith the cooler surface.\\nIf rain falls through a temperature inversion, it may\\nfreeze as it passes through the underlying cold air and\\nfall to the ground in the form of ice pellets. Ice pellets\\nare an indication of a temperature inversion and that\\nfreezing rain exists at a higher altitude. In the case of\\nhail, freezing water droplets are carried up and down\\nby drafts inside clouds, growing larger in size as they\\ncome in contact with more moisture. Once the updrafts\\ncan no longer hold the freezing water, it falls to the\\nEarth in the form of hail. Hail can be pea-sized, or it\\ncan grow as large as 5 inches in diameter, larger than a\\nsoftball.\\nSnow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that\\nfalls at a steady rate or in snow showers that begin,\\nchange in intensity, and end rapidly. Falling snow also\\nvaries in size, being very small grains or large flakes.\\nSnow grains are the equivalent of drizzle in size.\\nPrecipitation in any form poses a threat to safety of\\nflight. Often, precipitation is accompanied by low \\nceilings and reduced visibility. Aircraft that have ice,\\nsnow, or frost on their surfaces must be carefully\\ncleaned prior to beginning a flight because of the \\npossible airflow disruption and loss of lift. Rain can\\ncontribute to water in the fuel tanks. Precipitation can\\ncreate hazards on the runway surface itself, making\\ntakeoffs and landings difficult, if not impossible, due to\\nsnow, ice, or pooling water and very slick surfaces.\\nAIR MASSES\\nAir masses are large bodies of air that take on the \\ncharacteristics of the surrounding area, or source\\nregion. A source region is typically an area in which the\\nair remains relatively stagnant for a period of days or\\nlonger. During this time of stagnation, the air mass\\ntakes on the temperature and moisture characteristics\\nof the source region. Areas of stagnation can be found\\nin polar regions, tropical oceans, and dry deserts. Air\\nmasses are classified based on their region of \\norigination:\\n• Polar or Tropical\\n• Maritime or Continental\\nA continental polar air mass forms over a polar region\\nand brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air\\nmasses form over warm tropical waters like the\\nCaribbean Sea and bring warm, moist air. As the air\\nmass moves from its source region and passes over\\nland or water, the air mass is subjected to the varying\\nconditions of the land or water, and these modify the\\nnature of the air mass. [Figure 10-24]\\nAn air mass passing over a warmer surface will be\\nwarmed from below, and convective currents form,\\ncausing the air to rise. This creates an unstable air mass\\nwith good surface visibility. Moist, unstable air causes\\ncumulus clouds, showers, and turbulence to form.\\nConversely, an air mass passing over a colder surface\\ndoes not form convective currents, but instead creates a\\nstable air mass with poor surface visibility. The poor\\nsurface visibility is due to the fact that smoke, dust, and\\nother particles cannot rise out of the air mass and are\\ninstead trapped near the surface. A stable air mass can\\nproduce low stratus clouds and fog.\\nFRONTS\\nAs air masses move across bodies of water and land,\\nthey eventually come in contact with another air mass\\nwith different characteristics. The boundary layer\\nbetween two types of air masses is known as a front.\\nAn approaching front of any type always means\\nchanges to the weather are imminent.\\nAir Mass—An extensive body of air having fairly uniform properties of\\ntemperature and moisture.\\nCh 10.qxd  10/24/03  8:12 AM  Page 10-18'),\n",

As the flight progresses westward to\\nColumbus and closer to the oncoming warm front, the\\nclouds deepen and become increasingly stratiform in\\nappearance with a ceiling of 6,000 feet. The visibility\\ndecreases to 6 miles in haze with a falling barometric\\npressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather \\ndeteriorates to broken clouds at 2,000 feet with 3 miles\\nvisibility and rain. With the temperature and dewpoint\\nthe same, fog is likely. At St. Louis, the sky is overcast\\nwith low clouds and drizzle and the visibility is 1 mile.\\nBeyond Indianapolis, the ceiling and visibility would\\nbe too low to continue VFR. Therefore, it would be\\nwise to remain in Indianapolis until the warm front had\\npassed, which might require a day or two. \\nCOLD FRONT\\nA cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and\\nstable air advances and replaces a body of warmer air.\\nCold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, \\nprogressing at a rate of 25 to 30 m.p.h. However,\\nextreme cold fronts have been recorded moving at\\nspeeds of up to 60 m.p.h. A typical cold front moves in\\na manner opposite that of a warm front; because it is so\\ndense, it stays close to the ground and acts like a \\nsnowplow, sliding under the warmer air and forcing the\\nless dense air aloft.

The type of clouds that form\\ndepends on the stability of the warmer air mass. A cold\\nfront in the Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented\\nin a northeast to southwest manner and can be several \\nhundred miles long, encompassing a large area of land.\\nPrior to the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform \\nor towering cumulus clouds are present, and \\ncumulonimbus clouds are possible. Rain showers and\\nhaze are possible due to the rapid development of\\nclouds. The wind from the south-southwest helps to\\nreplace the warm temperatures with the relative colder\\nair. A high dewpoint and falling barometric pressure\\nare indicative of imminent cold front passage.\\nAs the cold front passes, towering cumulus or \\ncumulonimbus clouds continue to dominate the sky.\\nDepending on the intensity of the cold front, heavy rain\\nshowers form and might be accompanied by lightning,\\nthunder, and/or hail. More severe cold fronts can also\\nproduce tornadoes. During cold front passage, the \\nvisibility will be poor, with winds variable and gusty,\\nand the temperature and dewpoint drop rapidly. A\\nquickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out during\\nfrontal passage, then begins a gradual increase.\\nAfter frontal passage, the towering cumulus and \\ncumulonimbus clouds begin to dissipate to cumulus\\nclouds with a corresponding decrease in the \\nprecipitation. Good visibility eventually prevails with\\nthe winds from the west-northwest. Temperatures\\nremain cooler and the barometric pressure continues to\\nrise.\\nFAST-MOVING COLD FRONT\\nFast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure\\nsystems far behind the actual front. The friction\\nbetween the ground and the cold front retards the\\nmovement of the front and creates a steeper frontal \\nsurface. This results in a very narrow band of weather,\\nconcentrated along the leading edge of the front. If the\\nwarm air being overtaken by the cold front is relatively\\nstable, overcast skies and rain may occur for some \\ndistance ahead of the front. If the warm air is unstable,\\nscattered thunderstorms and rain showers may form. A\\ncontinuous line of thunderstorms, or a squall line, may\\nform along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present a\\nserious hazard to pilots as squall type thunderstorms\\nare intense and move quickly. Behind a fast moving\\ncold front, the skies usually clear rapidly and the front\\nleaves behind gusty, turbulent winds and colder \\ntemperatures.\\nFLIGHT TOWARD AN APPROACHING COLD\\nFRONT\\nLike warm fronts, not all cold fronts are the same.\\nExamining a flight toward an approaching cold front,\\npilots can get a better understanding of the type of \\nconditions that can be encountered in flight. Figure \\n10-27 shows a flight from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\\ntoward St. Louis, Missouri.\\nAt the time of departure from Pittsburgh, the weather is\\nVFR with 3 miles visibility in smoke and a scattered\\nlayer of clouds at 3,500 feet. As the flight progresses\\nwestward to Columbus and closer to the oncoming cold\\nfront, the clouds show signs of vertical development\\nwith a broken layer at 2,500 feet. The visibility is 6\\nmiles in haze with a falling barometric pressure.\\nApproaching Indianapolis, the weather has deteriorated\\nto overcast clouds at 1,000 feet, and 3 miles visibility\\nwith thunderstorms and heavy rain showers. At St.\\nLouis, the weather gets better with scattered clouds at\\n1,000 feet and a 10 mile visibility.  \\nA pilot using sound judgment based on the knowledge\\nof frontal conditions, would most likely remain in\\nIndianapolis until the front had passed. Trying to fly\\nbelow a line of thunderstorms or a squall line is \\nhazardous and foolish, and flight over the top of or\\naround the storm is not an option. Thunderstorms can\\nextend up to well over the capability of small airplanes\\nand can extend in a line for 300 to 500 miles.\\nCOMPARISON OF COLD AND WARM FRONTS\\nWarm fronts and cold fronts are very different in nature\\nas are the hazards associated with each front. They vary\\nin speed, composition, weather phenomenon, and \\nprediction. Cold fronts, which move at 20 to 35 m.p.h.,\\nmove very quickly in comparison to warm fronts,\\nwhich move at only 10 to 25 m.p.h. Cold fronts also\\npossess a steeper frontal slope. Violent weather activity\\nis associated with cold fronts and the weather usually\\noccurs along the frontal boundary, not in advance.\\nHowever, squall lines can form during the summer\\nmonths as far as 200 miles in advance of a severe cold\\nfront. Whereas warm fronts bring low ceilings, poor\\nvisibility, and rain, cold fronts bring sudden storms,\\ngusty winds, turbulence, and sometimes hail or \\ntornadoes.\\nCold fronts are fast approaching with little or no \\nwarning, and they make a complete weather change in\\njust a few hours. The weather clears rapidly after \\npassage and drier air with unlimited visibilities prevail.\\nWarm fronts, on the other hand, provide advance \\nwarning of their approach and can take days to pass\\nthrough a region.\\nWIND SHIFTS\\nWind around a high-pressure system rotates in a \\nclockwise fashion, while low-pressure winds rotate in a\\ncounter-clockwise manner. When two high-pressure\\nsystems are adjacent, the winds are almost in direct\\nCh 10.qxd  10/24/03  8:12 AM  Page 10-21'),\n",

Fronts\\nare the boundaries between two areas of pressure, and\\ntherefore, wind shifts are continually occurring within\\na front. Shifting wind direction is most pronounced in\\nconjunction with cold fronts.\\nSTATIONARY FRONT\\nWhen the forces of two air masses are relatively equal,\\nthe boundary or front that separates them remains \\nstationary and influences the local weather for days.\\nThis front is called a stationary front . The weather\\nassociated with a stationary front is typically a mixture\\nthat can be found in both warm and cold fronts.\\nOCCLUDED FRONT\\nAn occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold\\nfront catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As\\nthe occluded front approaches, warm front weather \\nprevails, but is immediately followed by cold front\\nweather. There are two types of occluded fronts that\\ncan occur, and the temperatures of the colliding frontal\\nsystems play a large part in defining the type of front\\nand the resulting weather. A cold front occlusion occurs\\nwhen a fast-moving cold front is colder than the air\\nahead of the slow-moving warm front. When this\\noccurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the\\nwarm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the\\ncold front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found\\nin both warm and cold fronts, providing the air is \\nrelatively stable. A warm front occlusion occurs when\\nthe air ahead of the warm front is colder than the air of\\nthe cold front. When this is the case, the cold front rides\\nup and over the warm front. If the air forced aloft by\\nthe warm front occlusion is unstable, the weather will\\nbe more severe than the weather found in a cold front\\nocclusion. Embedded thunderstorms, rain, and fog are\\nlikely to occur.\\nFigure 10-28 depicts a cross-section of a typical cold\\nfront occlusion. The warm front slopes over the \\nprevailing cooler air and produces the warm front type\\nweather. Prior to the passage of the typical occluded\\nfront, cirriform and stratiform clouds prevail, light to\\nheavy precipitation is falling, visibility is poor, \\ndewpoint is steady, and barometric pressure is \\nfalling. During the passage of the front, nimbostratus\\nand cumulonimbus clouds predominate, and towering\\ncumulus may also be possible. Light to heavy \\nprecipitation is falling, visibility is poor, winds are \\nvariable, and the barometric pressure is leveling off.\\nAfter the passage of the front, nimbostratus and \\naltostratus clouds are visible, precipitation is \\ndecreasing and clearing, and visibility is improving.\\nStationary Front—A boundary between two air masses that are \\nrelatively balanced.\\nOccluded Front—A frontal occlusion occurs when a fast-moving cold\\nfront catches up with a slow-moving warm front. The difference in \\ntemperature within each frontal system is a major factor in determining\\nwhether a cold or warm front occlusion occurs. \\n1011\\n1008100510051008\\n1011\\n1011 1011 1014\\n1014\\nCOLD AIR\\nMETAR  KSTL    1950Z      30018KT   10SM\\n              SCT010       08/02      A2979\\nMETAR  KIND    1950Z      20024KT   3SM    +TSRA\\n                OVC 010       24/23       A2974\\nMETAR  KCMH    1950Z      20012KT   6SM    HZ\\n              BKN025     25/24      A2983\\nMETAR  KPIT    1950Z      20012KT   3SM    FU\\n                SCT035       24/22       A2989\\nST.

These reports and forecasts\\nenable pilots to make informed decisions regarding\\nweather and flight safety.\\nOBSERVATIONS\\nThe data gathered from surface and upper altitude\\nobservations form the basis of all weather forecasts,\\nadvisories, and briefings. There are three types of\\nweather observations: surface, upper air, and radar.\\nSURFACE AVIATION WEATHER \\nOBSERVATIONS\\nSurface aviation weather observations (METARs) are a\\ncompilation of weather elements of the current weather\\nat ground stations across the United States. The \\nnetwork is made up of government run facilities and \\nprivately contracted facilities that provide up-to-date\\nweather information. Automated weather sources such\\nas automated weather observing systems (AWOS)\\nand automated surface observing systems (ASOS),\\nas well as other automated facilities, also play a major\\nrole in the gathering of surface observations. \\nSurface observations provide local weather conditions\\nand other relevant information. This information\\nincludes the type of report, station identifier, date and\\ntime, modifier (as required), wind, visibility, runway\\nvisual range (RVR), weather phenomena, sky \\ncondition, temperature/dewpoint, altimeter reading,\\nand applicable remarks. The information gathered for\\nthe surface observation may be from a person, an \\nautomated station, or an automated station that is\\nupdated or enhanced by a weather observer. In any\\nform, the surface observation provides valuable \\ninformation about airports around the country.\\nUPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS\\nObservations of upper air weather prove to be more\\nchallenging than surface observations. There are only\\ntwo methods by which upper air weather phenomena\\ncan be observed: radiosonde observations and pilot\\nAutomated Weather Observing System (A WOS)—Automated weather\\nreporting system consisting of various sensors, a processor, a \\ncomputer-generated voice subsystem, and a transmitter to broadcast\\nweather data. \\nAutomated Surface Observation System (ASOS)—Weather reporting\\nsystem which provides surface observations every minute via digitized\\nvoice broadcasts and printed reports.\\nRadiosonde—A weather instrument that observes and reports \\nmeteorological conditions from the upper atmosphere. This instrument\\nis typically carried into the atmosphere by some form of weather \\nballoon.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-1'),\n",

Using radio telemetry,\\nradiosonde observations are made by sounding \\nballoons from which weather data is received twice\\ndaily. These upper air observations provide \\ntemperature, humidity, pressure, and wind data for\\nheights up to and above 100,000 feet. In addition to\\nthis, pilots provide vital information regarding upper\\nair weather observations. Pilots remain the only \\nreal-time source of information regarding turbulence,\\nicing, and cloud heights, which is gathered from pilots\\nin flight, through the filing of pilot weather reports or\\nPIREPs. Together, pilot reports and radiosonde \\nobservations provide information on upper air \\nconditions important for flight planning. Many U.S.\\nand international airlines have equipped their aircraft\\nwith instrumentation that automatically transmits \\nin-flight weather observations through the DataLink\\nsystem to the airline dispatcher who disseminates the\\ndata to appropriate weather forecasting authorities.\\nRADAR OBSERVATIONS\\nWeather observers use three types of radar to provide\\ninformation about precipitation, wind, and weather \\nsystems. The WSR-88D NEXRAD radar, commonly\\ncalled Doppler radar, provides in-depth observations\\nthat inform surrounding communities of impending\\nweather. FAA terminal doppler weather radar (TDWR),\\ninstalled at some major airports around the country,\\nalso aids in providing severe weather alerts and \\nwarnings to airport traffic controllers. Terminal radar\\nensures pilots are aware of wind shear, gust fronts, and\\nheavy precipitation, all of which are dangerous to \\narriving and departing aircraft. The third type of radar\\ncommonly used in the detection of precipitation is the\\nFAA airport surveillance radar. This radar is used \\nprimarily to detect aircraft; however, it also detects the\\nlocation and intensity of precipitation which is used to\\nroute aircraft traffic around severe weather in an airport\\nenvironment.\\nSERVICE OUTLETS\\nService outlets are government or private facilities that\\nprovide aviation weather services. Several different\\ngovernment agencies, including the Federal Aviation\\nAdministration (FAA), National Oceanic and\\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the\\nNational Weather Service (NWS) work in conjunction\\nwith private aviation companies to provide different\\nmeans of accessing weather information.\\nFAA FLIGHT SERVICE STATION\\nThe FAA Flight Service Station (FSS) is the primary\\nsource for preflight weather information. A preflight\\nweather briefing from an automated FSS (AFSS) can\\nbe obtained 24 hours a day by calling 1-800-WX\\nBRIEF almost anywhere in the U.S. In areas not served\\nby an AFSS, National Weather Service facilities may\\nprovide pilot weather briefings. Telephone numbers for\\nNWS facilities and additional numbers for\\nFSSs/AFSSs can be found in the Airport/Facility\\nDirectory (A/FD) or in the U.S. Government section of\\nthe telephone book. \\nFlight Service Stations also provide in-flight weather\\nbriefing services, as well as scheduled and unscheduled\\nweather broadcasts. An FSS may also furnish weather\\nadvisories to flights within the FSS region of authority. \\nTRANSCRIBED INFORMATION \\nBRIEFING SERVICE (TIBS)\\nThe Transcribed Information Briefing Service (TIBS)\\nis a service which is prepared and disseminated by\\nselected Automated Flight Service Stations. It provides\\ncontinuous telephone recordings of meteorological and\\naeronautical information. Specifically, TIBS provides\\narea and route briefings, airspace procedures, and \\nspecial announcements. It is designed to be a \\npreliminary briefing tool and is not intended to replace\\na standard briefing from an FSS specialist.\\nThe TIBS service is available 24 hours a day and is\\nupdated when conditions change, but it can only be\\naccessed by a TOUCH-TONE\\n\\uf6d9 phone. The phone\\nnumbers for the TIBS service are listed in the A/FD.\\nDIRECT USER ACCESS \\nTERMINAL SERVICE (DUATS)\\nThe Direct User Access Terminal Service, which is\\nfunded by the FAA, allows any pilot with a current\\nmedical certificate to access weather information and\\nfile a flight plan via computer. Two methods of access\\nare available to connect with DUATS. The first is on\\nthe Internet through DynCorp at http://www.duats.com\\nor Data Transformation Corporation at\\nhttp://www.duat.com. The second method requires a\\nmodem and a communications program supplied by a\\nDUATS provider. To access the weather information\\nand file a flight plan by this method, pilots use a toll\\nfree telephone number to connect the user’s computer\\ndirectly to the DUATS computer. The current vendors\\nof DUATS service and the associated phone numbers\\nare listed in Chapter 7 of the Aeronautical Information\\nManual (AIM).\\nENROUTE FLIGHT ADVISORY SERVICE\\nA service specifically designed to provide timely\\nenroute weather information upon pilot request is\\nknown as the enroute flight advisory service (EFAS),\\nor Flight Watch. EFAS provides a pilot with weather\\nadvisories tailored to the type of flight, route, and cruis-\\ning altitude. EFAS can be one of the best sources for\\ncurrent weather information along the route of flight. \\nA pilot can usually contact an EFAS specialist from 6\\na.m. to 10 p.m. anywhere in the conterminous U.S. and\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-2'),\n",

The common EFAS frequency, 122.0\\nMHz, is established for pilots of aircraft flying between\\n5,000 feet AGL and 17,500 feet MSL. \\nHAZARDOUS IN-FLIGHT WEATHER \\nADVISORY (HIWAS)\\nHIWAS is a national program for broadcasting haz-\\nardous weather information continuously over selected\\nnavaids. The broadcasts include advisories such as\\nAIRMETS, SIGMETS, convective SIGMETS , and\\nurgent PIREPs. These broadcasts are only a summary\\nof the information, and pilots should contact an FSS or\\nEFAS for detailed information. Navaids that have\\nHIWAS capability are depicted on sectional charts with\\nan “H” in the upper right corner of the identification\\nbox. [Figure 11-1]\\nTRANSCRIBED WEATHER BROADCAST\\n(TWEB)\\nA transcribed weather broadcast is a weather report\\ntransmitted continuously over selected navaids. On a\\nsectional chart, a “T” in the upper right-hand corner of\\nthe navaid box indicates TWEB availability. TWEB\\nweather usually consists of route-orientated data\\nincluding route forecasts, forecast outlook, winds aloft,\\nand other selected weather reports for an area within 50\\nnautical miles (NM) of the FSS or for a 50-mile wide\\ncorridor along a specific route. A TWEB forecast is\\nvalid for 12 hours and is updated four times a day.\\nWEATHER BRIEFINGS\\nPrior to every flight, pilots should gather all \\ninformation vital to the nature of the flight. This\\nincludes an appropriate weather briefing obtained from\\na specialist at an FSS, AFSS, or NWS. \\nFor weather specialists to provide an appropriate\\nweather briefing, they need to know which of the three\\ntypes of briefings is needed—a standard briefing, an\\nabbreviated briefing, or an outlook briefing. Other\\nhelpful information is whether the flight is visual flight\\nrule (VFR) or instrument flight rule (IFR), aircraft\\nidentification and type, departure point, estimated time\\nof departure (ETD), flight altitude, route of flight, \\ndestination, and estimated time en route (ETE).\\nThis information is recorded in the flight plan system,\\nand a note is made regarding the type of weather \\nbriefing provided. If necessary, it can be referenced\\nlater to file or amend a flight plan. It is also used when\\nan aircraft is overdue or is reported missing.\\nSTANDARD BRIEFING\\nA standard briefing is the most complete report and \\nprovides the overall weather picture. This type of \\nbriefing should be obtained prior to the departure of\\nany flight and should be used during flight planning. A\\nstandard briefing provides the following information in\\nsequential order if it is applicable to the route of flight.\\n1. Adverse Conditions— This includes informa-\\ntion about adverse conditions that may \\ninfluence a decision to cancel or alter the route\\nof flight. Adverse conditions includes \\nsignificant weather, such as thunderstorms or\\naircraft icing, or other important items such as\\nairport closings.\\n2. VFR Flight NOT RECOMMENDED— If\\nthe weather for the route of flight is below\\nVFR minimums, or if it is doubtful the flight\\ncould be made under VFR conditions due to\\nthe forecast weather, the briefer may state that\\nVFR is not recommended. It is the pilot’s \\ndecision whether or not to continue the flight\\nunder VFR, but this advisory should be\\nweighed carefully.\\n3. Synopsis— The synopsis is an overview of the\\nlarger weather picture. Fronts and major\\nweather systems that affect the general area\\nare provided.\\nH\\nSymbol Indicates HIWAS\\nFigure 11-1. HIWAS availability is shown on sectional chart.\\nAIRMET—In-flight weather advisory concerning moderate icing,\\nmoderate turbulence, sustained winds of 30 knots or more at the \\nsurface, and widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet and/or \\nvisibility less than 3 miles.\\nSIGMET—An in-flight weather advisory that is considered significant\\nto all aircraft. SIGMET criteria include severe icing, severe and\\nextreme turbulence, duststorms, sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and\\nvolcanic ash that lower visibility to less than 3 miles.\\nConvective SIGMET—A weather advisory concerning convective\\nweather significant to the safety of all aircraft. Convective SIGMETs\\nare issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, thunderstorms over a\\nwide area, embedded thunderstorms, wind gusts to 50 knots or greater,\\nand/or hail \\n3/4 inch in diameter or greater.\\nUrgent PIREP—Any pilot report that contains any of the following\\nweather phenomena: tornadoes, funnel clouds, or waterspouts; severe\\nor extreme turbulence, including clear air turbulence; severe icing; hail;\\nvolcanic ash; or low-level wind shear.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-3'),\n",

Current Conditions— This portion of the \\nbriefing contains the current ceilings, \\nvisibility, winds, and temperatures. If the\\ndeparture time is more than 2 hours away, \\ncurrent conditions will not be included in the\\nbriefing.\\n5. En Route Forecast— The en route forecast is\\na summary of the weather forecast for the \\nproposed route of flight.\\n6. Destination Forecast— The destination \\nforecast is a summary of the expected weather\\nfor the destination airport at the estimated time\\nof arrival (ETA).\\n7. Winds and Temperatures Aloft— Winds and\\ntemperatures aloft is a report of the winds at\\nspecific altitudes for the route of flight.\\nHowever, the temperature information is \\nprovided only on request.\\n8. Notices to Airmen— This portion supplies\\nNOTAM information pertinent to the route of\\nflight which has not been published in the\\nNotice to Airmen publication. Published\\nNOTAM information is provided during the\\nbriefing only when requested.\\n9. ATC Delays— This is an advisory of any\\nknown air traffic control (ATC) delays that\\nmay affect the flight.\\n10. Other Information— At the end of the \\nstandard briefing, the FSS specialist will \\nprovide the radio frequencies needed to open a\\nflight plan and to contact en route flight \\nadvisory service (EFAS). Any additional \\ninformation requested is also provided at this\\ntime.\\nABBREVIATED BRIEFING\\nAn abbreviated briefing is a shortened version of the\\nstandard briefing. It should be requested when a \\ndeparture has been delayed or when specific weather\\ninformation is needed to update the previous briefing.\\nWhen this is the case, the weather specialist needs to\\nknow the time and source of the previous briefing so\\nthe necessary weather information will not be omitted\\ninadvertently.\\nOUTLOOK BRIEFING\\nAn outlook briefing should be requested when a\\nplanned departure is 6 or more hours away. It provides\\ninitial forecast information that is limited in scope due\\nto the timeframe of the planned flight. This type of\\nbriefing is a good source of flight planning information\\nthat can influence decisions regarding route of flight,\\naltitude, and ultimately the go, no-go decision. A\\nfollow-up briefing prior to departure is advisable since\\nan outlook briefing generally only contains \\ninformation based on weather trends and existing\\nweather in geographical areas at or near the departure\\nairport.\\nAVIATION WEATHER REPORTS\\nAviation weather reports are designed to give accurate\\ndepictions of current weather conditions. Each report\\nprovides current information that is updated at \\ndifferent times. Some typical reports are aviation \\nroutine weather reports (METAR), pilot weather\\nreports (PIREPs), and radar weather reports (SDs).\\nAVIATION ROUTINE WEATHER REPORT\\n(METAR)\\nAn aviation routine weather report, or METAR, is an\\nobservation of current surface weather reported in a\\nstandard international format. While the METAR code\\nhas been adopted worldwide, each country is allowed\\nto make modifications to the code. Normally, these \\ndifferences are minor but necessary to accommodate\\nlocal procedures or particular units of measure. This\\ndiscussion of METAR will cover elements used in the\\nUnited States.\\nExample:\\nMETAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26 3/4SM\\n+TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK\\nPRESFR\\nA typical METAR report contains the following \\ninformation in sequential order:\\n1. Type of Report— There are two types of\\nMETAR reports. The first is the routine\\nMETAR report that is transmitted every hour.\\nThe second is the aviation selected special\\nweather report (SPECI). This is a special\\nreport that can be given at any time to update\\nthe METAR for rapidly changing weather \\nconditions, aircraft mishaps, or other critical\\ninformation.\\n2. Station Identifier— Each station is identified\\nby a four-letter code as established by the\\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization\\n(ICAO). In the 48 contiguous states, a unique\\nthree-letter identifier is preceded by the letter\\n“K.” For example, Gregg County Airport in\\nLongview, Texas, is identified by the letters\\n“KGGG,” K being the country designation\\nand GGG being the airport identifier. In other\\nregions of the world, including Alaska and\\nHawaii, the first two letters of the four-letter\\nICAO identifier indicate the region, country,\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-4'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='11-5\\nor state. Alaska identifiers always begin with\\nthe letters “PA” and Hawaii identifiers always\\nbegin with the letters “PH.” A list of station\\nidentifiers can be found at an FSS or NWS\\noffice.\\n3. Date and Time of Report— The date and time\\n(161753Z ) are depicted in a six-digit group.\\nThe first two digits of the six-digit group are\\nthe date. The last four digits are the time of the\\nMETAR, which is always given in\\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC). A “Z” is\\nappended to the end of the time to denote the\\ntime is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed\\nto local time.\\n4. Modifier— Modifiers denote that the METAR\\ncame from an automated source or that the\\nreport was corrected. If the notation “AUTO”\\nis listed in the METAR, the report came from\\nan automated source. It also lists “AO1” or\\n“AO2” in the remarks section to indicate the\\ntype of precipitation sensors employed at the\\nautomated station. \\nWhen the modifier “ COR” is used, it \\nidentifies a corrected report sent out to replace\\nan earlier report that contained an error.\\nExample:\\nMETAR KGGG 161753Z COR\\n5. Wind— Winds are reported with five digits\\n(14021) unless the speed is greater than 99\\nknots, in which case the wind is reported with\\nsix digits. The first three digits indicate the\\ndirection the wind is blowing in tens of\\ndegrees. If the wind is variable, it is reported\\nas “VRB.” The last two digits indicate the\\nspeed of the wind in knots (KT) unless the\\nwind is greater than 99 knots, in which case it\\nis indicated by three digits. If the winds are\\ngusting, the letter “G” follows the windspeed\\n(G26). After the letter “G,” the peak gust\\nrecorded is provided. If the wind varies more\\nthan 60° and the windspeed is greater than 6\\nknots, a separate group of numbers, separated\\nby a “V,” will indicate the extremes of the\\nwind directions.\\n6. Visibility— The prevailing visibility (3/4 SM)\\nis reported in statute miles as denoted by the \\nletters “SM.” It is reported in both miles and\\nfractions of miles. At times, RVR, or runway\\nvisual range is reported following the \\nprevailing visibility. RVR is the distance a\\npilot can see down the runway in a moving \\naircraft. When RVR is reported, it is shown\\nwith an R, then the runway number followed\\nby a slant, then the visual range in feet. For\\nexample, when the RVR is reported as\\nR17L/1400FT, it translates to a visual range of\\n1,400 feet on runway 17 left. \\n7. Weather— Weather can be broken down into\\ntwo different categories: qualifiers and\\nweather phenomenon (+TSRA BR). First, the\\nqualifiers of intensity, proximity, and the\\ndescriptor of the weather will be given. The\\nintensity may be light (-), moderate ( ), or\\nheavy (+). Proximity only depicts weather\\nphenomena that are in the airport vicinity. The\\nnotation “VC” indicates a specific weather\\nphenomenon is in the vicinity of 5 to 10 miles\\nfrom the airport. Descriptors are used to\\ndescribe certain types of precipitation and\\nobscurations. Weather phenomena may be\\nreported as being precipitation, obscurations,\\nand other phenomena such as squalls or funnel\\nclouds. Descriptions of weather phenomena as\\nthey begin or end, and hailstone size are also\\nlisted in the remarks sections of the report.\\n[Figure 11-2]\\n8. Sky Condition— Sky condition ( BKN008\\nOVC012CB ) is always reported in the\\nsequence of amount, height, and type or \\nindefinite ceiling/height (vertical visibility).\\nThe heights of the cloud bases are reported\\nwith a three-digit number in hundreds of feet\\nabove the ground. Clouds above 12,000 feet\\nare not detected or reported by an automated\\nstation. The types of clouds, specifically \\ntowering cumulus (TCU) or cumulonimbus\\n(CB) clouds, are reported with their height.\\nContractions are used to describe the amount\\nof cloud coverage and obscuring phenomena.\\nThe amount of sky coverage is reported in\\neighths of the sky from horizon to horizon.\\n[Figure 11-3]\\n9. Temperature and Dewpoint— The air \\ntemperature and dewpoint are always given in\\ndegrees Celsius ( 18/17). Temperatures below\\n0°C are preceded by the letter “M” to indicate\\nminus.\\n10. Altimeter Setting— The altimeter setting is\\nreported as inches of mercury in a four-digit\\nnumber group (A2970). It is always preceded\\nby the letter “A.” Rising or falling pressure\\nmay also be denoted in the remarks sections as\\n“PRESRR” or “PRESFR” respectively.\\nZulu Time—A term used in aviation for coordinated universal time\\n(UTC) which places the entire world on one time standard.\\nCh 11.qxd  10/24/03  8:17 AM  Page 11-5'),\n",

The information\\ncontained in this section may include wind\\ndata, variable visibility, beginning and ending\\ntimes of particular phenomenon, pressure\\ninformation, and various other information\\ndeemed necessary. An example of a remark\\nregarding weather phenomenon that does not\\nfit in any other category would be: OCNL\\nLTGICCG. This translates as occasional \\nlightning in the clouds, and from cloud to\\nground. Automated stations also use the\\nremarks section to indicate the equipment\\nneeds maintenance. The remarks section\\nalways begins with the letters “RMK.”\\nExample:\\nMETAR BTR 161753Z 14021G26 3/4SM -RA BR \\nBKN008 OVC012 18/17 A2970 RMK PRESFR\\nExplanation:\\nType of Report: ...............Routine METAR\\nLocation: ........................Baton Rouge, Louisiana\\nDate: ...............................16\\nth day of the month\\nTime: ..............................1753 Zulu\\nModifier: ........................None shown\\nWind Information: ..........Winds 140°at 21 knots \\ngusting to 26 knots\\nVisibility: ........................3/4 statute mile\\nWeather: .........................light rain and mist\\nSky Conditions: ..............Skies broken 800 feet, \\novercast 1,200\\nTemperature: ..................Temperature 18°C, dewpoint\\n17°C\\nAltimeter: .......................29.70 in.

If the ceiling is below 5,000\\nfeet, or visibility is at or below 5 miles, ATC facilities\\nare required to solicit PIREPs from pilots in the area.\\nWhen unexpected weather conditions are encountered,\\npilots are encouraged to make a report to an FSS or\\nATC. When a pilot weather report is filed, the ATC\\nfacility or FSS will add it to the distribution system to\\nbrief other pilots and provide in-flight advisories.\\nPIREPs are easy to file and a standard reporting form\\noutlines the manner in which they should be filed.\\nFigure 11-4 shows the elements of a PIREP form. Item\\nnumbers one through five are required information\\nwhen making a report, as well as at least one weather\\nphenomenon encountered.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='RADAR WEATHER REPORTS (SD)\\nAreas of precipitation and thunderstorms are observed\\nby radar on a routine basis. Radar weather reports are\\nissued by radar stations at 35 minutes past the hour,\\nwith special reports issued as needed.\\nRadar weather reports provide information on the type,\\nintensity, and location of the echo top of the \\nprecipitation. [Figure 11-5] These reports may also\\ninclude direction and speed of the area of precipitation\\nas well as the height and base of the precipitation in\\nhundreds of feet MSL. RAREPs are especially \\nvaluable for preflight planning to help avoid areas of\\nsevere weather. However, radar only detects objects in\\nthe atmosphere that are large enough to be considered\\nprecipitation. Cloud bases and tops, ceilings, and \\nvisibility are not detected by radar.\\nA typical RAREP will include:\\n• Location identifier and time of radar observation.\\n• Echo pattern:\\n1. Line (LN)—A line of precipitation\\nechoes at least 30 miles long, at least four\\ntimes as long as it is wide, and at least 25 per-\\ncent coverage within the line.\\n2. Area (AREA)—A group of echoes of\\nsimilar type and not classified as a line.\\n3. Single Cell (CELL)—A single \\nisolated convective echo such as a rain shower. \\n• Area coverage in tenths.\\n• Type and intensity of weather.\\n• Azimuth, referenced to true north, and range, in\\nnautical miles, from the radar site, of points \\ndefining the echo pattern. For lines and areas,\\nthere will be two azimuth and range sets that\\ndefine the pattern. For cells, there will be only one\\nazimuth and range set. \\n• Dimension of echo pattern—The dimension of an\\necho pattern is given when the azimuth and range\\ndefine only the center line of the pattern.\\n• Cell movement—Movement is only coded for\\ncells; it will not be coded for lines or areas. \\n• Maximum top of precipitation and location.\\nMaximum tops may be coded with the symbols\\n“MT” or “MTS.” If it is coded with “MTS,” it\\nmeans that satellite data as well as radar \\ninformation was used to measure the top of the\\nprecipitation.\\n• If the word “AUTO” appears in the report, it\\nmeans the report is automated from WSR-88D\\nweather radar data.\\n• The last section is primarily used to prepare radar\\nsummary charts, but can be used during preflight\\nto determine the maximum precipitation intensity\\nwithin a specific grid box.

The echo pattern for this radar report\\nindicates a line of echos covering 8/10ths of the area.\\nThunderstorms and very heavy rain showers are \\nindicated. The next set of numbers indicate the azimuth\\nthat defines the echo (86° at 40 NM and 199° at 115\\nNM). Next, the dimension of this echo is given as 20\\nnautical miles wide (10 nautical miles on either side of\\nthe line defined by the azimuth and range). The cells\\nwithin the line are moving from 240 ° at 25 knots. The\\nmaximum top of the precipitation, as determined by\\nradar and satellite, is 57,000 feet and it is located on the\\n159° radial, 65 NM out. The last line indicates the\\nintensity of the precipitation, for example in grid QM\\nthe intensity is 3 or heavy precipitation. (1 is light and\\n6 is extreme.)\\nAVIATION FORECASTS\\nObserved weather condition reports are often used in\\nthe creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of\\ndifferent forecast products are produced and designed\\nto be used in the preflight planning stage. The printed\\nforecasts that pilots need to be familiar with are the \\nterminal aerodrome forecast (TAF), aviation area \\nforecast (FA), in-flight weather advisories (SIGMET,\\nAIRMET), and the winds and temperatures aloft \\nforecast (FD).\\nTERMINAL AERODROME \\nFORECASTS (TAF)\\nA terminal aerodrome forecast is a report established\\nfor the 5 statute mile radius around an airport. TAF\\nreports are usually given for larger airports. Each TAF\\nis valid for a 24-hour time period, and is updated four\\ntimes a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The\\nTAF utilizes the same descriptors and abbreviations as\\nused in the METAR report.\\nThe terminal forecast includes the following \\ninformation in sequential order:\\n1. Type of Report— A TAF can be either a \\nroutine forecast (TAF) or an amended forecast\\n(TAF AMD).\\n2. ICAO Station Identifier— The station \\nidentifier is the same as that used in a METAR.\\n3. Date and Time of Origin— Time and date of\\nTAF origination is given in the six-number\\ncode with the first two being the date, the last\\nfour being the time. Time is always given in\\nUTC as denoted by the Z following the \\nnumber group.\\n4. Valid Period Date and Time— The valid\\nforecast time period is given by a six-digit\\nnumber group. The first two numbers indicate\\nthe date, followed by the two-digit beginning\\ntime for the valid period, and the last two \\ndigits are the ending time.\\n5. Forecast Wind— The wind direction and\\nspeed forecast are given in a five-digit number\\ngroup. The first three indicate the direction of\\nthe wind in reference to true north. The last\\ntwo digits state the windspeed in knots as\\ndenoted by the letters “KT.” Like the METAR,\\nwinds greater than 99 knots are given in three\\ndigits.\\n6. Forecast Visibility— The forecast visibility is\\ngiven in statute miles and may be in whole\\nnumbers or fractions. If the forecast is greater\\nthan 6 miles, it will be coded as “P6SM.”\\n7. Forecast Significant Weather— Weather\\nphenomenon is coded in the TAF reports in the\\nsame format as the METAR. If no significant\\nweather is expected during the forecast time\\nperiod, the denotation “NSW” will be included\\nin the “becoming” or “temporary” weather\\ngroups.\\n8. Forecast Sky Condition— Forecast sky con-\\nditions are given in the same manner as the\\nMETAR. Only cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are\\nforecast in this portion of the TAF report as\\nopposed to CBs and towering cumulus in the\\nMETAR.\\n9. Forecast Change Group— For any \\nsignificant weather change forecast  to occur\\nduring the TAF time period, the expected \\nconditions and time period are included in this\\ngroup. This information may be shown as\\nFrom (FM), Becoming (BECMG), and\\nTemporary (TEMPO). “From” is used when a\\nrapid and significant change, usually within an\\nhour, is expected. “Becoming” is used when a\\ngradual change in the weather is expected over\\na period of no more than 2 hours. “Temporary”\\nis used for temporary fluctuations of weather,\\nexpected to last for less than an hour.\\n10.

There are six\\nareas for which area forecasts are published in the \\ncontiguous 48 states. Area forecasts are issued three\\ntimes a day and are valid for 18 hours. This type of\\nforecast gives information vital to en route operations\\nas well as forecast information for smaller airports that\\ndo not have terminal forecasts.\\nArea forecasts are typically disseminated in four \\nsections and include the following information:\\n1. Header— This gives the location identifier of\\nthe source of the FA, the date and time of\\nissuance, the valid forecast time, and the area\\nof coverage.\\nExample:\\nDFWC FA 120945\\nSYNOPSIS AND VFR CLDS/WX\\nSYNOPSIS V ALID UNTIL 130400\\nCLDS/WX V ALID UNTIL 122200…OTLK V ALID\\n122200-130400\\nOK TX AR LA MS AL AND CSTL WTRS\\nExplanation:\\nThe area forecast shows information given by Dallas\\nFort Worth, for the region of Oklahoma, Texas,\\nArkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, as\\nwell as a portion of the gulf coastal waters.

These advisories are also available\\nto pilots prior to departure for flight planning purposes.\\nAn in-flight weather advisory is issued in the form of\\neither an AIRMET, SIGMET, or Convective SIGMET.\\nAIRMAN’S METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION\\n(AIRMET)\\nAIRMETs (WAs) are examples of in-flight weather\\nadvisories that are issued every 6 hours with \\nintermediate updates issued as needed for a particular\\narea forecast region. The information contained in an\\nAIRMET is of operational interest to all aircraft, but\\nthe weather section concerns phenomena considered\\npotentially hazardous to light aircraft and aircraft with\\nlimited operational capabilities. \\nAn AIRMET includes forecast of moderate icing, \\nmoderate turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30\\nknots or greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than\\n1,000 feet and/or visibilities less than 3 miles, and\\nextensive mountain obscurement.\\nEach AIRMET bulletin has a fixed alphanumeric \\ndesignator, numbered sequentially for easy \\nidentification, beginning with the first issuance of the\\nday. SIERRA is the AIRMET code used to denote\\ninstrument flight rules (IFR) and mountain \\nobscuration; TANGO is used to denote turbulence,\\nstrong surface winds, and low-level wind shear; and\\nZULU is used to denote icing and freezing levels.\\nExample:\\nDFWT WA 241650\\nAIRMET TANGO UPDT 3 FOR TURBC… STG\\nSFC WINDS  AND LLWS V ALID UNTIL 242000\\nAIRMET TURBC… OK TX…UPDT\\nFROM OKC TO DFW TO SAT TO MAF TO CDS\\nTO OKC OCNL MDT TURBC BLO 60 DUE TO\\nSTG AND GUSTY LOW LVL WINDS. CONDS\\nCONTG BYD 2000Z\\nExplanation:\\nThis AIRMET was issued by Dallas Fort Worth on the\\n24\\nth day of the month, at 1650 Zulu time. On this third\\nupdate, the AIRMET Tango is issued for turbulence,\\nstrong surface winds, and low-level wind shear until\\n2000 Zulu on the same day. The turbulence section of\\nthe AIRMET is an update for Oklahoma and Texas. It\\ndefines an area from Oklahoma City to Dallas, Texas,\\nto San Antonio, to Midland, Texas, to Childress, Texas,\\nto Oklahoma City that will experience occasional \\nmoderate turbulence below 6,000 feet due to strong and\\ngusty low-level winds. It also notes that these \\nconditions are forecast to continue beyond 2000 Zulu. \\nSIGNIFICANT METEOROLOGICAL \\nINFORMATION (SIGMET)\\nSIGMETs (WSs) are in-flight advisories concerning\\nnon-convective weather that is potentially hazardous to\\nall aircraft. They report weather forecasts that include\\nsevere icing not associated with thunderstorms, severe\\nor extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not\\nassociated with thunderstorms, dust storms or \\nsandstorms that lower surface or in-flight visibilities to\\nbelow 3 miles, and volcanic ash. \\nSIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid for\\n4 hours, but if the SIGMET relates to hurricanes, it is\\nvalid for 6 hours. \\nA SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier,\\nfrom November through Yankee, excluding Sierra and\\nTango. The first issuance of a SIGMET is designated as\\na UWS, or Urgent Weather SIGMET. Re-issued\\nSIGMETs for the same weather phenomenon are\\nsequentially numbered until the weather phenomenon\\nends.\\nExample:\\nSFOR WS 100130\\nSIGMET ROME02 V ALID UNTIL 100530\\nOR WA\\nFROM SEA TO PDT TO EUG TO SEA\\nOCNL MOGR CAT BTN 280 AND 350 EXPCD\\nDUE TO JTSTR.\\nCONDS BGNG AFT 0200Z CONTG BYD 0530Z .\\nExplanation:\\nThis is SIGMET Romeo 2, the second issuance for this\\nweather phenomenon.

They are numbered\\nsequentially each day from 1-99, beginning at 00 Zulu\\ntime. If no hazardous weather exists, the Convective\\nSIGMET will still be issued; however, it will state\\n“CONVECTIVE SIGMET….

The current date is the 22\\nnd of\\nthe month and it was issued at 1855 Zulu. It is\\nConvective SIGMET number 21C, indicating that it is\\nthe 21st consecutive report issued for the central United\\nStates. This report is valid for 2 hours until 2055 Zulu\\ntime. The Convective SIGMET is for an area from\\nKansas to Oklahoma to Texas, in the vicinity of a line\\nfrom Goodland, Kansas, to Childress, Texas. No \\nsignificant thunderstorms are being reported, but a line\\nof thunderstorms will develop by 1955 Zulu time and\\nwill move eastward at a rate of 30-35 knots through\\n2055 Zulu. Hail up to 2 inches in size is possible with\\nthe developing thunderstorms. \\nWINDS AND TEMPERATURE ALOFT \\nFORECAST (FD)\\nWinds and temperatures aloft forecasts provide wind\\nand temperature forecasts for specific locations in the\\ncontiguous United States, including network locations\\nin Hawaii and Alaska. The forecasts are made twice a\\nday based on the radiosonde upper air observations\\ntaken at 0000Z and 1200Z.\\nThrough 12,000 feet are true altitudes and above\\n18,000 feet are pressure altitudes. Wind direction is\\nalways in reference to true north and windspeed is\\ngiven in knots. The temperature is given in degrees\\nCelsius. No winds are forecast when a given level is\\nwithin 1,500 feet of the station elevation. Similarly,\\ntemperatures are not forecast for any station within\\n2,500 feet of the station elevation.\\nIf the windspeed is forecast to be greater than 100 knots\\nbut less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the\\ndirection and subtracts 100 from the speed. To decode\\nthis type of data group, the reverse must be \\naccomplished. For example, when the data appears as\\n“731960,” subtract 50 from the 73 and add 100 to the\\n19, and the wind would be 230 ° at 119 knots with a\\ntemperature of –60 °C. If the windspeed is forecast to\\nbe 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded as 99\\nknots. For example, when the data appears as “7799,”\\nsubtract 50 from 77 and add 100 to 99, and the wind is\\n270° at 199 knots or greater. When the forecast \\nwindspeed is calm or less than 5 knots, the data group\\nis coded “9900,” which means light and variable.\\n[Figure 11-7]\\nExplanation of figure 11-7:\\nThe heading indicates that this FD was transmitted on\\nthe 15th of the month at 1640Z and is based on the 1200\\nZulu radiosonde. The valid time is 1800 Zulu on the\\nsame day and should be used for the period between\\n1700Z and 2100Z. The heading also indicates that the\\ntemperatures above 24,000 feet MSL are negative.\\nSince the temperatures above 24,000 feet are negative,\\nthe minus sign is omitted.\\nA 4-digit data group shows the wind direction in \\nreference to true north, and the windspeed in knots. The\\nelevation at Amarillo, TX (AMA) is 3,605 feet, so the\\nlowest reportable altitude is 6,000 feet for the forecast\\nwinds. In this case, “2714” means the wind is forecast\\nto be from 270°at a speed of 14 knots.\\nA 6-digit group includes the forecast temperature aloft.\\nThe elevation at Denver (DEN) is 5,431 feet, so the\\nlowest reportable altitude is 9,000 feet for the winds\\nand temperature forecast. In this case, “2321-04” \\nindicates the wind is forecast to be from 230°at a speed\\nof 21 knots with a temperature of –4°C.\\nFD KWBC 151640\\nBASED ON 151200Z DATA\\nVALID 151800Z FOR USE 1700-2100Z \\nTEMPS NEGATIVE ABV 24000\\nFD      3000     6000       9000       12000       18000       24000     30000\\nAMA                2714     2725+00  2625-04    2531-15   2542-27   265842\\nDEN                             2321-04   2532-08    2434-19   2441-31   235347\\nFigure 11-7.

Significant weather prognostic charts \\nprovide an overall forecast weather picture.\\nSURFACE ANALYSIS CHART\\nThe surface analysis chart, depicts an analysis of the\\ncurrent surface weather. [Figure 11-8] This chart is a\\ncomputer prepared report that is transmitted every 3\\nhours and covers the contiguous 48 states and adjacent\\nareas. A surface analysis chart shows the areas of high\\nand low pressure, fronts, temperatures, dewpoints,\\nwind directions and speeds, local weather, and visual\\nobstructions.\\nSurface weather observations for reporting points\\nacross the United States are also depicted on this chart.\\nEach of these reporting points is illustrated by a station\\nmodel. [Figure 11-9] A station model will include:\\n• Type of Observation— A round model indicates\\nan official weather observer made the \\nobservation. A square model indicates the \\nobservation is from an automated station.\\nStations located offshore give data from ships,\\nbuoys, or offshore platforms.\\n• Sky Cover— The station model depicts total sky\\ncover and will be shown as clear, scattered, \\nbroken, overcast, or obscured/partially obscured.\\n• Clouds— Cloud types are represented by specific\\nsymbols. Low cloud symbols are placed beneath\\nthe station model, while middle and high cloud\\nsymbols are placed directly above the station\\nmodel. Typically, only one type of cloud will be\\ndepicted with the station model.\\n• Sea Level Pressure— Sea level pressure given in\\nthree digits to the nearest tenth of a millibar. For\\n1000 mbs or greater, prefix a 10 to the three \\ndigits. For less than 1000 mbs, prefix a 9 to the\\nthree digits.\\n• Pressure Change/Tendency— Pressure change\\nin tenths of millibars over the past 3 hours. This\\nis depicted directly below the sea level pressure.\\n• Precipitation— A record of the precipitation that\\nhas fallen over the last 6 hours to the nearest \\nhundredth of an inch.\\n• Dewpoint— Dewpoint is given in degrees\\nFahrenheit.\\nFigure 11-8.

[Figure \\n11-11] The chart is published hourly at 35 minutes past\\nthe hour. It displays areas of precipitation as well as \\ninformation regarding the characteristics of the \\nprecipitation. [Figure 11-12] A radar summary chart\\nincludes:\\n• No information— If information is not reported,\\nthe chart will say “NA.” If no echoes are\\ndetected, the chart will say “NE.”\\n• Precipitation intensity contours— Intensity can\\nbe described as one of six levels and is shown on\\nthe chart by three contour intervals. \\n• Height of tops— The heights of the echo tops are\\ngiven in hundreds of feet MSL.\\n• Movement of cells— Individual cell movement\\nis indicated by an arrow pointing in the direction\\nof movement. The speed of movement in knots is\\nthe number at the top of the arrow head. “LM”\\nindicates little movement.\\n• Type of precipitation— The type of precipitation\\nis marked on the chart using specific symbols.\\nThese symbols are not the same as used on the\\nMETAR charts.\\n• Echo configuration— Echoes are shown as\\nbeing areas, cells, or lines.\\n• Weather watches— Severe weather watch areas\\nfor tornadoes and severe thunderstorms are\\ndepicted by boxes outlined with heavy dashed\\nlines.\\nThe radar summary chart is a valuable tool for preflight\\nplanning. It does, however, contain several limitations\\nfor the usage of the chart. This chart depicts only areas\\nof precipitation. It will not show areas of clouds and\\nfog with no appreciable precipitation, or the height of\\nthe tops and bases of the clouds. Radar summary charts\\nare a depiction of current precipitation and should be\\nused in conjunction with current METAR and weather\\nforecasts.\\nFigure 11-10.

The primary\\nconcern of this discussion is the low-level significant\\nweather prognostic chart.\\nThe low-level chart comes in two forms: the 12- and\\n24-hour forecast chart, and the 36 and 48 surface only\\nforecast chart. The first chart is a four-panel chart that\\nincludes 12- and 24-hour forecasts for significant\\nweather and surface weather. Charts are issued four\\ntimes a day at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z. The\\nvalid time for the chart is printed on the lower left-hand\\ncorner of each panel.\\nThe upper two panels show forecast significant\\nweather, which may include nonconvective turbulence,\\nfreezing levels, and IFR or MVFR weather. Areas of\\nmoderate or greater turbulence are enclosed in dashed\\nlines. Numbers within these areas give the height of the\\nturbulence in hundreds of feet MSL. Figures below the\\nline show the anticipated base, while figures above the\\nline show the top of the zone of turbulence. Also shown\\non this panel are areas of VFR, IFR, and MVFR. IFR\\nareas are enclosed by solid lines, MVFR areas are\\nenclosed by scalloped lines, and the remaining, \\nunenclosed area is designated VFR. Zigzag lines and\\nthe letters “SFC” indicate freezing levels in that area\\nare at the surface. Freezing level height contours for\\nthe highest freezing level are drawn at 4,000-foot \\nintervals with dashed lines.\\nThe lower two panels show the forecast surface\\nweather and depicts the forecast locations and \\ncharacteristics of pressure systems, fronts, and \\nprecipitation. Standard symbols are used to show fronts\\nand pressure centers. Direction of movement of the\\npressure center is depicted by an arrow. The speed, in\\nknots, is shown next to the arrow. In addition, areas of\\nforecast precipitation and thunderstorms are outlined.\\nAreas of precipitation that are shaded indicate at least\\none-half of the area is being affected by the precipita-\\ntion. Unique symbols indicate the type of precipitation\\nand the manner in which it occurs. \\nFigure 11-13 depicts a typical significant weather \\nprognostic chart as well as the symbols typically used\\nto depict precipitation. Prognostic charts are an \\nexcellent source of information for preflight planning;\\nhowever, this chart should be viewed in light of current\\nconditions and specific local area forecasts.\\nThe 36- and 48-hour significant weather prognostic\\nchart is an extension of the 12- and 24-hour forecast. It\\nprovides information regarding only surface weather\\nforecasts and includes a discussion of the forecast. This\\nchart is issued only two times a day. It typically \\ncontains forecast positions and characteristics of \\npressure patterns, fronts, and precipitation.

An airport may\\nbe a small sod field or a large complex utilized by air\\ncarriers. This chapter discusses airport operations\\nand identifies features of an airport complex, as well\\nas provides information on operating on or in the\\nvicinity of an airport.\\nTYPES OF AIRPORTS\\nThere are two types of airports.\\n• Controlled Airport\\n• Uncontrolled Airport\\nCONTROLLED AIRPORT\\nA controlled airport has an operating control tower. Air\\ntraffic control (ATC) is responsible for providing for\\nthe safe, orderly, and expeditious flow of air traffic at\\nairports where the type of operations and/or volume of\\ntraffic requires such a service. Pilots operating from a\\ncontrolled airport are required to maintain two-way\\nradio communication with air traffic controllers, and to\\nacknowledge and comply with their instructions.\\nPilots must advise ATC if they cannot comply with the\\ninstructions issued and request amended instructions.\\nA pilot may deviate from an air traffic instruction in an\\nemergency, but must advise ATC of the deviation as\\nsoon as possible.\\nUNCONTROLLED AIRPORT\\nAn uncontrolled airport does not have an operating\\ncontrol tower. Two-way radio communications are not\\nrequired, although it is a good operating practice for\\npilots to transmit their intentions on the specified fre-\\nquency for the benefit of other traffic in the area. Figure\\n12-1 lists recommended communication procedures.\\nMore information on radio communications will be\\ndiscussed later in this chapter.\\nSOURCES FOR AIRPORT DATA\\nWhen a pilot flies into a different airport, it is\\nimportant to review the current data for that airport.\\nThis data can provide the pilot with information,\\nsuch as communication frequencies, services avail-\\nable, closed runways, or airport construction. Three\\ncommon sources of information are:\\n• Aeronautical Charts\\n• Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)\\n• Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)\\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS\\nAeronautical charts provide specific information on\\nairports.

It would be helpful to review an\\nA/FD to become familiar with the information it\\ncontains.\\nNOTICES TO AIRMEN\\nNotices to Airmen (NOTAMs) provide the most current\\ninformation available. They provide time-critical infor-\\nmation on airports and changes that affect the national\\nairspace system and are of concern to instrument flight\\nrule (IFR) operations. NOTAM information is classified\\ninto three categories. These are NOTAM-D or distant,\\nNOTAM-L or local, and flight data center (FDC)\\nNOTAMs. NOTAM-Ds are attached to hourly weather\\nreports and are available at flight service stations\\n(AFSS/FSS). NOTAM-Ls include items of a local nature,\\nsuch as taxiway closures or construction near a runway.\\nThese NOTAMs are maintained at the FSS nearest the\\nairport affected. NOTAM-Ls must be requested from an\\nFSS other than the one nearest the local airport for which\\nthe NOTAM was issued. FDC NOTAMs are issued by\\nthe National Flight Data Center and contain regulatory\\ninformation, such as temporary flight restrictions or an\\namendment to instrument approach procedures. The\\nNOTAM-Ds and FDC NOTAMs are contained in the\\nNotices to Airmen publication, which is issued every 28\\ndays. Prior to any flight, pilots should check for any\\nNOTAMs that could affect their intended flight.\\nAIRPORT MARKINGS AND SIGNS\\nThere are markings and signs used at airports, which\\nprovide directions and assist pilots in airport opera-\\ntions. Some of the most common markings and signs\\nwill be discussed. Additional information may be found\\nin the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).\\nRUNWAY MARKINGS\\nRunway markings vary depending on the type of oper-\\nations conducted at the airport. Figure 12-3 shows a\\nrunway that is approved as a precision instrument\\napproach runway and also shows some other common\\nrunway markings. A basic VFR runway may only have\\ncenterline markings and runway numbers.\\nSince aircraft are affected by the wind during takeoffs\\nand landings, runways are laid out according to the\\nlocal prevailing winds. Runway numbers are in refer-\\nence to magnetic north. Certain airports have two or\\neven three runways laid out in the same direction.\\nThese are referred to as parallel runways and are distin-\\nguished by a letter being added to the runway number.\\nExamples are runway 36L (left), 36C (center), and 36R\\n(right).\\nAnother feature of some runways is a displaced thresh-\\nold. A threshold may be displaced because of an\\nobstruction near the end of the runway. Although this\\nportion of the runway is not to be used for landing, it\\nmay be available for taxiing, takeoff, or landing rollout.\\nSome airports may have a blast pad/stopway area. The\\nblast pad is an area where a propeller or jet blast can\\ndissipate without creating a hazard. The stopway area\\nis paved in order to provide space for an airplane to\\ndecelerate and stop in the event of an aborted takeoff.\\nThese areas cannot be used for takeoff or landing.\\nTAXIWAY MARKINGS\\nAirplanes use taxiways to transition from parking\\nareas to the runway. Taxiways are identified by a con-\\ntinuous yellow centerline stripe. A taxiway may\\ninclude edge markings to define the edge of the taxi-\\nway. This is usually done when the taxiway edge does\\nnot correspond with the edge of the pavement. If an\\nedge marking is a continuous line, the paved shoulder\\nis not intended to be used by an airplane. If it is a\\ndashed marking, an airplane may use that portion of\\nthe pavement. Where a taxiway approaches a runway,\\nthere may be a holding position marker. These consist\\nof four yellow lines (two solid and two dashed). The\\nsolid lines are where the airplane is to hold. At some\\ncontrolled airports, holding position markings may be\\nfound on a runway. They are used when there are\\nintersecting runways, and air traffic control issues\\ninstructions such as “cleared to land—hold short of\\nrunway 30.”\\nOTHER MARKINGS\\nSome of the other markings found on the airport\\ninclude vehicle roadway markings, VOR receiver\\ncheckpoint markings, and non-movement area bound-\\nary markings.\\nVehicle roadway markings are used when necessary to\\ndefine a pathway for vehicle crossing areas that are also\\nintended for aircraft. These markings usually consist of\\na solid white line to delineate each edge of the roadway\\nand a dashed line to separate lanes within the edges of\\nthe roadway.\\nA VOR receiver checkpoint marking consists of a\\npainted circle with an arrow in the middle. The arrow is\\naligned in the direction of the checkpoint azimuth. This\\nallows pilots to check aircraft instruments with naviga-\\ntional aid signals.\\nA non-movement area boundary marking delineates a\\nmovement area under air traffic control. These mark-\\nings are yellow and located on the boundary between\\nthe movement and non-movement area. They normally\\nconsist of two yellow lines (one solid and one dashed).\\nAIRPORT SIGNS\\nThere are six types of signs that may be found at air-\\nports.

Figure 12-4\\nshows examples of signs, their purpose, and appropri-\\nate pilot action. The six types of signs are:\\n• Mandatory Instruction Signs —have a red\\nbackground with a white inscription. These signs\\ndenote an entrance to a runway, a critical area, or\\na prohibited area.\\n• Location Signs—are black with yellow inscrip-\\ntion and a yellow border and do not have arrows.\\nThey are used to identify a taxiway or runway\\nlocation, to identify the boundary of the runway,\\nor identify an instrument landing system (ILS)\\ncritical area.\\n• Direction Signs —have a yellow background\\nwith black inscription. The inscription identifies\\nthe designation of the intersecting taxiway(s)\\nleading out of an intersection.\\n• Destination Signs —have a yellow background\\nwith black inscription and also contain arrows.\\nThese signs provide information on locating\\nthings, such as runways, terminals, cargo areas,\\nand civil aviation areas.\\n19\\nA\\nA\\n4\\nLEGEND\\nIn-Pavement Runway Guard Lights\\nElevated Runway Guard Lights\\nStop Bar\\nCenterline/Lead-On Lights\\nClearance Bar Lights\\nPosition Marking4\\nStop Bar/\\nILS Hold Vehicle\\nLanes\\n(Zipper Style)\\nSurface\\nPainted\\nRunway\\nMarking\\nTaxiway Edge\\nMarking\\n(Do Not Cross)\\nTaxiway/\\nTaxiway\\nHold\\nMarking\\nHold\\nMarking\\nFor Land\\nAnd Hold\\nShort\\nOperations\\nTerminal\\n}\\nNon-Movement Area\\nFigure 12-3.

These signs are used to\\nprovide the pilot with information on such things\\nas areas that cannot be seen from the control\\ntower, applicable radio frequencies, and noise\\nabatement procedures. The airport operator deter-\\nmines the need, size, and location of these signs.\\n• Runway Distance Remaining Signs —have a\\nblack background with white numbers. The\\nnumbers indicate the distance of the remaining\\nrunway in thousands of feet.\\nAIRPORT LIGHTING\\nThe majority of airports have some type of lighting\\nfor night operations. The variety and type of lighting\\nsystems depends on the volume and complexity of\\noperations at a given airport. Airport lighting is stan-\\ndardized so that airports use the same light colors for\\nrunways and taxiways.\\nAIRPORT BEACON\\nAirport beacons help a pilot identify an airport at night.\\nThe beacons are operated from dusk till dawn and\\nsometimes they are turned on if the ceiling is less than\\n1,000 feet and/or the ground visibility is less than 3\\nstatute miles (visual flight rules minimums). However,\\nthere is no requirement for this, so a pilot has the\\nresponsibility of determining if the weather is VFR.\\nThe beacon has a vertical light distribution to make it\\nmost effective from 1-10° above the horizon, although\\nit can be seen well above or below this spread. The bea-\\ncon may be an omnidirectional capacitor-discharge\\ndevice, or it may rotate at a constant speed, which pro-\\nduces the visual effect of flashes at regular intervals.\\nThe combination of light colors from an airport beacon\\nindicates the type of airport. [Figure 12-5]\\nSome of the most common beacons are:\\n• Flashing white and green for civilian land\\nairports.\\n• Flashing white and yellow for a water airport.\\n• Flashing white, yellow, and green for a heliport.\\n• Two quick white flashes followed by a green\\nflash identifies a military airport.\\n4-22\\n8-APCH\\nILS\\n4\\nB\\n22\\nJ\\nL\\n22\\nMIL\\n Hold short of runway on taxiway\\nExit boundary of ILS critical area\\nDefines directions to takeoff runways\\nDefines directions for arriving aircraft\\nProvides remaining runway length\\nin 1,000 feet increments\\nIndicates taxiway does not continue\\nDefines direction & designation of exit taxiway\\nfrom runway\\nRunway Exit:.\\nDefines direction & designation of intersecting\\ntaxiway(s)\\nTaxiway Direction:\\nHold short of aircraft on approach\\nHold short of ILS approach critical area\\nIdentifies paved areas where aircraft entry is\\nprohibited\\nIdentifies taxiway on which aircraft is located\\nIdentifies runway on which aircraft is located\\nTaxiway/Runway Hold Position:\\nRunway  Approach Hold Position:\\nILS Critical Area Hold Position:\\nExit boundary of runway protected areas\\nRunway Safety Area/Obstacle Free\\nZone Boundary:\\nILS Critical Area Boundary:\\nNo Entry:\\nTaxiway Location:\\nOutbound Destination:\\nInbound Destination:\\nTaxiway Ending MarkerRunway Location:\\nRunway Distance Remaining\\nTYPE OF SIGN AND ACTION OR PURPOSETYPE OF SIGN AND ACTION OR PURPOSE\\nAIRPORT SIGN SYSTEMS\\n26-8\\nRunway/Runway Hold Position:\\n Hold short of intersecting runway\\nA      LG\\nDirection Sign Array:\\nIdentifies location in conjunction with\\nmultiple intersecting taxiways\\nFigure 12-4.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='12-6\\nAPPROACH LIGHT SYSTEMS\\nApproach light systems are primarily intended to\\nprovide a means to transition from instrument flight\\nto visual flight for landing. The system configura-\\ntion depends on whether the runway is a precision or\\nnonprecision instrument runway. Some systems\\ninclude sequenced flashing lights, which appear to\\nthe pilot as a ball of light traveling toward the run-\\nway at high speed. Approach lights can also aid\\npilots operating under VFR at night.\\nVISUAL GLIDESLOPE INDICATORS\\nVisual glideslope indicators provide the pilot with\\nglidepath information that can be used for day or night\\napproaches. By maintaining the proper glidepath as\\nprovided by the system, a pilot should have adequate\\nobstacle clearance and should touch down within a\\nspecified portion of the runway.\\nVISUAL APPROACH SLOPE INDICATOR\\nVisual approach slope indicator (VASI) installations\\nare the most common visual glidepath systems in use.\\nThe VASI provides obstruction clearance within 10°\\nof the runway extended runway centerline, and to 4\\nnautical miles (NM) from the runway threshold.\\nA V ASI consists of light units arranged in bars. There\\nare 2-bar and 3-bar VASIs. The 2-bar VASI has near\\nand far light bars and the 3-bar V ASI has near, middle,\\nand far light bars. Two-bar V ASI installations provide\\none visual glidepath which is normally set at 3°. The\\n3-bar system provides two glidepaths with the lower\\nglidepath normally set at 3° and the upper glidepath\\none-fourth degree above the lower glidepath.\\nThe basic principle of the V ASI is that of color differen-\\ntiation between red and white. Each light unit projects a\\nbeam of light having a white segment in the upper part\\nof the beam and a red segment in the lower part of the\\nbeam. The lights are arranged so the pilot will see the\\ncombination of lights shown in figure 12-6 to indicate\\nbelow, on, or above the glidepath.\\nOTHER GLIDEPATH SYSTEMS\\nA precision approach path indicator (PAPI) uses lights\\nsimilar to the V ASI system except they are installed in\\na single row, normally on the left side of the runway.\\n[Figure 12-7]\\nA tri-color system consists of a single light unit pro-\\njecting a three-color visual approach path. A below the\\nglidepath indication is red, on the glidepath color is\\ngreen, and above the glidepath is indicated by amber.\\nWhen descending below the glidepath, there is a small\\narea of dark amber. Pilots should not mistake this area\\nfor an “above the glidepath” indication. [Figure 12-8]\\nThere are also pulsating systems, which consist of a\\nsingle light unit projecting a two-color visual approach\\npath. A below the glidepath indication is shown by a\\nsteady red light, slightly below is indicated by pulsat-\\ning red, on the glidepath is indicated by a steady white\\nlight, and a pulsating white light indicates above the\\nglidepath. [Figure 12-9]\\nRUNWAY LIGHTING\\nThere are various lights that identify parts of the runway\\ncomplex. These assist a pilot in safely making a takeoff\\nor landing during night operations.\\nRUNWAY END IDENTIFIER LIGHTS\\nRunway end identifier lights (REIL) are installed at\\nmany airfields to provide rapid and positive identifi-\\nHigh\\n(More Than\\n3.5 Degrees)\\nSlightly High\\n(3.2 Degrees)\\nOn Glidepath\\n(3 Degrees)\\nSlightly Low\\n(2.8 Degrees)\\nLow\\n(Less Than\\n2.5 Degrees)\\nBelow Glidepath\\nNear Bar\\nFar Bar\\nOn Glidepath Above Glidepath\\nFigure 12-6. 2-Bar VASI system.\\nFigure 12-7.

The\\nsystem consists of a pair of synchronized flashing\\nlights located laterally on each side of the runway\\nthreshold. REILs may be either omnidirectional or\\nunidirectional facing the approach area.\\nRUNWAY EDGE LIGHTS\\nRunway edge lights are used to outline the edges of\\nrunways at night or during low visibility conditions.\\nThese lights are classified according to the intensity\\nthey are capable of producing. They are classified as\\nhigh intensity runway lights (HIRL), medium intensity\\nrunway lights (MIRL), or low intensity runway lights\\n(LIRL). The HIRL and MIRL have variable intensity\\nsettings. These lights are white, except on instrument\\nrunways, where amber lights are used on the last 2,000\\nfeet or half the length of the runway, whichever is less.\\nThe lights marking the end of the runway are red.\\nIN-RUNWAY LIGHTING\\nTouchdown zone lights (TDZL), runway centerline\\nlights (RCLS), and taxiway turnoff lights are installed\\non some precision runways to facilitate landing under\\nadverse visibility conditions. TDZLs are two rows of\\ntransverse light bars disposed symmetrically about the\\nrunway centerline in the runway touchdown zone.\\nRCLS consists of flush centerline lights spaced at 50\\nfoot intervals beginning 75 feet from the landing\\nthreshold. Taxiway turnoff lights are flush lights, which\\nemit a steady green color.\\nCONTROL OF AIRPORT LIGHTING\\nAirport lighting is controlled by air traffic controllers\\nat controlled airports. At uncontrolled airports, the\\nlights may be on a timer, or where an FSS is located at\\nan airport, the FSS personnel may control the light-\\ning. A pilot may request various light systems be\\nturned on or off and also request a specified intensity,\\nif available, from ATC or FSS personnel. At selected\\nuncontrolled airports, the pilot may control the light-\\ning by using the radio. This is done by selecting a\\nspecified frequency and clicking the radio micro-\\nphone.

[Figure 12-10]\\nTAXIWAY LIGHTS\\nOmnidirectional taxiway lights outline the edges of the\\ntaxiway and are blue in color. At many airports, these\\nedge lights may have variable intensity settings that\\nmay be adjusted by an air traffic controller when\\ndeemed necessary or when requested by the pilot.\\nSome airports also have taxiway centerline lights that\\nare green in color.\\nOBSTRUCTION LIGHTS\\nObstructions are marked or lighted to warn pilots of\\ntheir presence during daytime and nighttime condi-\\ntions. Obstruction lighting can be found both on and\\noff an airport to identify obstructions. They may be\\nmarked or lighted in any of the following conditions.\\n• Red Obstruction Lights—either flash or emit a\\nsteady red color during nighttime operations, and\\nthe obstructions are painted orange and white for\\ndaytime operations.\\n• High Intensity White Obstruction Light —\\nflashes high intensity white lights during the\\ndaytime with the intensity reduced for nighttime.\\n• Dual Lighting—is a combination of flashing red\\nbeacons and steady red lights for nighttime oper-\\nation, and high intensity white lights for daytime\\noperations.\\nWIND DIRECTION INDICATORS\\nIt is important for a pilot to know the direction of the\\nwind. At facilities with an operating control tower,\\nthis information is provided by ATC. Information\\nmay also be provided by FSS personnel located at a\\nparticular airport or by requesting information on a\\ncommon traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) at air-\\nports that have the capacity to receive and broadcast\\non this frequency.\\nWhen none of these services is available, it is possible\\nto determine wind direction and runway in use by\\nvisual wind indicators. A pilot should check these wind\\nindicators even when information is provided on the\\nCTAF at a given airport because there is no assurance\\nthat the information provided is accurate.\\nWind direction indicators include a wind sock, wind\\ntee, or tetrahedron. These are usually located in a cen-\\ntral location near the runway and may be placed in the\\ncenter of a segmented circle, which will identify the\\ntraffic pattern direction, if it is other than the standard\\nleft-hand pattern. [Figures 12-11 and 12-12]\\nThe wind sock is a good source of information since it\\nnot only indicates wind direction, but allows the pilot\\nto estimate the wind velocity and gusts or factor. The\\nwind sock extends out straighter in strong winds and\\nwill tend to move back and forth when the wind is\\ngusty. Wind tees and tetrahedrons can swing freely, and\\nwill align themselves with the wind direction. The wind\\ntee and tetrahedron can also be manually set to align\\nwith the runway in use; therefore, a pilot should also\\nlook at the wind sock, if available.\\nRADIO COMMUNICATIONS\\nOperating in and out of a controlled airport, as well\\nas in a good portion of the airspace system, requires\\nthat an aircraft have two-way radio communication\\ncapability. For this reason, a pilot should be knowl-\\nedgeable of radio station license requirements and\\nradio communications equipment and procedures.\\nRADIO LICENSE\\nThere is no license requirement for a pilot operating\\nin the United States; however, a pilot who operates\\ninternationally is required to hold a restricted\\nradiotelephone permit issued by the Federal\\nCommunications Commission (FCC). There is also\\nno station license requirement for most general avia-\\ntion aircraft operating in the United States. A station\\nlicense is required however for an aircraft which is\\noperating internationally, which uses other than a very\\nhigh frequency (VHF) radio, and which meets other\\ncriteria.\\nRADIO EQUIPMENT\\nIn general aviation, the most common types of radios\\nare VHF. A VHF radio operates on frequencies\\nbetween 118.0 and 136.975 and is classified as 720 or\\n760 depending on the number of channels it can\\naccommodate. The 720 and 760 uses .025 spacing\\n(118.025, 118.050) with the 720 having a frequency\\nrange up to 135.975 and the 760 going up to 136.975.\\nVHF radios are limited to line of sight transmissions;\\n7 times within 5\\nseconds\\n5 times within 5\\nseconds\\n3 times within 5\\nseconds\\nHighest intensity available\\nMedium or lower intensity\\n(Lower REIL or REIL off)\\nLowest intensity available\\n(Lower REIL or REIL off)\\nKEY MIKE FUNCTION\\nFigure 12-10.

When communicating with\\nATC, pilots should use this alphabet to identify their\\naircraft. [Figure 12-13]\\nLOST COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES\\nIt is possible that a pilot might experience a malfunc-\\ntion of the radio. This might cause the transmitter,\\nreceiver, or both to become inoperative. If a receiver\\nbecomes inoperative and a pilot needs to land at a con-\\ntrolled airport, it is advisable to remain outside or\\nabove Class D airspace until the direction and flow of\\ntraffic is determined. A pilot should then advise the\\ntower of the aircraft type, position, altitude, and\\nintention to land.

During\\ndaylight hours air traffic control transmissions may be\\nacknowledged by rocking the wings, and at night by\\nblinking the landing light.\\nWhen both receiver and transmitter are inoperative, the\\npilot should remain outside of Class D airspace until\\nthe flow of traffic has been determined and then enter\\nthe pattern and watch for light signals.\\nIf a radio malfunctions prior to departure, it is advisable\\nto have it repaired, if possible. If this is not possible, a\\ncall should be made to air traffic control and the pilot\\nshould request authorization to depart without two-way\\nradio communications. If authorization is given to\\ndepart, the pilot will be advised to monitor the appro-\\npriate frequency and/or watch for light signals as\\nappropriate.\\nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SERVICES\\nBesides the services provided by FSS as discussed in\\nChapter 11, there are numerous other services provided\\nby A TC. In many instances a pilot is required to have con-\\ntact with air traffic control, but even when not required, a\\npilot will find it helpful to request their services.\\nPRIMARY RADAR\\nRadar is a method whereby radio waves are transmitted\\ninto the air and are then received when they have been\\nreflected by an object in the path of the beam.

A transponder is also\\nrequired to operate in certain controlled airspace.\\nAirspace is discussed in chapter 13.\\nA transponder code consists of four numbers from\\nzero to seven (4,096 possible codes). There are some\\nstandard codes, or ATC may issue a four-digit code to\\nan aircraft. When a controller requests a code or func-\\ntion on the transponder, the word “squawk” may be\\nused.

The traffic is referenced by azimuth from the\\naircraft in terms of the 12-hour clock. Also the distance\\nin nautical miles, direction in which the target is mov-\\ning, and the type and altitude of the aircraft, if known,\\nare given. An example would be: “Traffic 10 o’clock 5\\nmiles east bound, Cessna 152, 3,000 feet.” The pilot\\nshould note that traffic position is based on the aircraft\\ntrack, and that wind correction can affect the clock\\nposition at which a pilot locates traffic. [Figure 12-16]\\nWAKE TURBULENCE\\nAll aircraft generate a wake while in flight. This distur-\\nbance is caused by a pair of counter-rotating vortices\\ntrailing from the wingtips. The vortices from larger air-\\ncraft pose problems to encountering aircraft. The wake of\\nthese aircraft can impose rolling moments exceeding the\\nroll-control authority of the encountering aircraft. Also,\\nthe turbulence generated within the vortices can damage\\naircraft components and equipment if encountered at\\nclose range. For this reason, a pilot must envision the\\nlocation of the vortex wake and adjust the flightpath\\naccordingly.\\nDuring ground operations and during takeoff, jet-\\nengine blast (thrust stream turbulence) can cause\\ndamage and upsets at close range.

The lowest pressure occurs over\\nthe upper wing surface, and the highest pressure under\\nthe wing. This pressure differential triggers the rollup of\\nthe airflow aft of the wing resulting in swirling air\\nmasses trailing downstream of the wingtips. After the\\nrollup is completed, the wake consists of two counter-\\nrotating cylindrical vortices. Most of the energy is within\\na few feet of the center of each vortex, but pilots should\\navoid a region within about 100 feet of the vortex core.\\n[Figure 12-17]\\nVORTEX STRENGTH\\nThe strength of the vortex is governed by the weight,\\nspeed, and shape of the wing of the generating aircraft.\\nThe vortex characteristics of any given aircraft can also\\nbe changed by the extension of flaps or other wing con-\\nfiguration devices as well as by a change in speed. The\\ngreatest vortex strength occurs when the generating air-\\ncraft is heavy, clean, and slow.\\nVORTEX BEHAVIOR\\nTrailing vortices have certain behavioral characteristics\\nthat can help a pilot visualize the wake location and take\\navoidance precautions.\\nVortices are generated from the moment an aircraft\\nleaves the ground, since trailing vortices are the by-\\nproduct of wing lift. The vortex circulation is outward,\\nupward, and around the wingtips when viewed from\\neither ahead or behind the aircraft. Tests have shown\\nthat vortices remain spaced a bit less than a wingspan\\napart, drifting with the wind, at altitudes greater than a\\nwingspan from the ground. Tests have also shown that\\nthe vortices sink at a rate of several hundred feet per\\nminute, slowing their descent and diminishing in\\nstrength with time and distance behind the generating\\naircraft. [Figure 12-18]\\nWhen the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the\\nground (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move lat-\\nerally over the ground at a speed of 2 or 3 knots. A\\ncrosswind will decrease the lateral movement of the\\nupwind vortex and increase the movement of the down-\\nwind vortex. A tailwind condition can move the vortices\\nof the preceding aircraft forward into the touchdown\\nzone.\\nVORTEX AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on the same\\nrunway—stay at or above the larger aircraft’s\\napproach flightpath and land beyond its touch-\\ndown point.\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on a parallel\\nrunway closer than 2,500 feet—consider the\\npossibility of drift and stay at or above the larger\\naircraft’s final approach flightpath and note its\\ntouchdown point.\\n• Landing behind a larger aircraft on crossing run-\\nway—cross above the larger aircraft’s flightpath.\\nFigure 12-17.

If the larger aircraft rotates prior\\nto the intersection, avoid flight below its flight-\\npath. Abandon the approach unless a landing is\\nensured well before reaching the intersection.\\n• Departing behind a large aircraft, rotate prior to\\nthe large aircraft’s rotation point and climb above\\nits climb path until turning clear of the wake.\\n• For intersection takeoffs on the same runway, be\\nalert to adjacent larger aircraft operations, partic-\\nularly upwind of the runway of intended use. If\\nan intersection takeoff clearance is received,\\navoid headings that will cross below the larger\\naircraft’s path.\\n• If departing or landing after a large aircraft execut-\\ning a low approach, missed approach, or touch and\\ngo landing (since vortices settle and move laterally\\nnear the ground, the vortex hazard may exist along\\nthe runway and in the flightpath, particularly in a\\nquartering tailwind), it is prudent to wait 2 minutes\\nprior to a takeoff or landing.\\n• En route it is advisable to avoid a path below\\nand behind a large aircraft, and if a large aircraft\\nis observed above on the same track, change the\\naircraft position laterally and preferably\\nupwind.\\nCOLLISION AVOIDANCE\\nTitle 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)\\npart 91 has established right-of-way rules, minimum\\nsafe altitudes, and VFR cruising altitudes to enhance\\nflight safety. The pilot can contribute to collision avoid-\\nance by being alert and scanning for other aircraft. This\\nis particularly important in the vicinity of an airport.\\nEffective scanning is accomplished with a series of\\nshort, regularly spaced eye movements that bring suc-\\ncessive areas of the sky into the central visual field.\\nEach movement should not exceed 10°, and each\\nshould be observed for at least 1 second to enable\\ndetection. Although back and forth eye movements\\nseem preferred by most pilots, each pilot should\\ndevelop a scanning pattern that is most comfortable and\\nthen adhere to it to assure optimum scanning.\\nEven if entitled to the right-of-way, a pilot should give\\nway if it is felt another aircraft is too close.\\nCLEARING PROCEDURES\\nThe following procedures and considerations\\nshould assist a pilot in collision avoidance under\\nvarious situations.\\n• Before Takeoff—Prior to taxiing onto a runway\\nor landing area in preparation for takeoff, pilots\\nshould scan the approach area for possible land-\\ning traffic, executing appropriate maneuvers to\\nprovide a clear view of the approach areas.\\n• Climbs and Descents —During climbs and\\ndescents in flight conditions which permit visual\\ndetection of other traffic, pilots should execute\\ngentle banks left and right at a frequency which\\npermits continuous visual scanning of the air-\\nspace.\\n• Straight and Level —During sustained peri-\\nods of straight-and-level flight, a pilot should\\nexecute appropriate clearing procedures at\\nperiodic intervals.\\n• Traffic Patterns —Entries into traffic patterns\\nwhile descending should be avoided.\\n• Traffic at VOR Sites—Due to converging traffic,\\nsustained vigilance should be maintained in the\\nvicinity of VORs and intersections.\\n• Training Operations —Vigilance should be\\nmaintained and clearing turns should be made\\nprior to a practice maneuver. During instruction,\\nthe pilot should be asked to verbalize the clearing\\nprocedures (call out “clear left, right, above, and\\nbelow”).\\nHigh-wing and low-wing aircraft have their respective\\nblind spots. High-wing aircraft should momentarily\\nraise their wing in the direction of the intended turn and\\nlook for traffic prior to commencing the turn. Low-\\nwing aircraft should momentarily lower the wing.\\nRUNWAY INCURSION AVOIDANCE\\nIt is important to give the same attention to operat-\\ning on the surface as in other phases of flights.\\nProper planning can prevent runway incursions and\\nthe possibility of a ground collision. A pilot should\\nbe aware of the airplane’s position on the surface at\\nall times and be aware of other aircraft and vehicle\\noperations on the airport.

At these locations, the FSS provides advi-\\nsory service to arriving and departing aircraft.\\nMILITARY TRAINING ROUTES\\nMilitary training routes (MTR) are developed to\\nallow the military to conduct low-altitude, high-\\nspeed training. The routes above 1,500 feet AGL\\nare developed to be flown primarily under IFR, and\\nthe routes 1,500 feet and less are for VFR flight.\\nThe routes are identified on sectional charts by the\\ndesignation “instrument (IR) or visual (VR).”\\nTEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS\\nAn FDC NOTAM will be issued to designate a tem-\\nporary flight restriction (TFR).

The NOTAM will also contain\\nthe FAA coordination facility and telephone number,\\nthe reason for the restriction, and any other informa-\\ntion deemed appropriate. The pilot should check the\\nNOTAMs as part of flight planning.\\nSome of the purposes for establishing a temporary\\nrestriction are:\\n• Protect persons and property in the air or on the \\nsurface from an existing or imminent hazard.\\n• Provide a safe environment for the operation of \\ndisaster relief aircraft.\\n• Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing\\naircraft above an incident or event, which may\\ngenerate a high degree of public interest.\\n• Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian \\nreasons in the State of Hawaii.\\n• Protect the President, Vice President, or other \\npublic figures.\\n• Provide a safe environment for space agency \\noperations.\\nPARACHUTE JUMP AREAS\\nParachute jump areas are published in the\\nAirport/Facility Directory .

The methods used in this chapter include\\npilotage—navigating by reference to visible landmarks,\\ndead reckoning—computations of direction and dis-\\ntance from a known position, and radio navigation—by\\nuse of radio aids.\\nAERONAUTICAL CHARTS\\nAn aeronautical chart is the road map for a pilot flying\\nunder VFR. The chart provides information which\\nallows pilots to track their position and provides avail-\\nable information which enhances safety. The three\\naeronautical charts used by VFR pilots are:\\n• Sectional Charts\\n• VFR Terminal Area Charts\\n• World Aeronautical Charts\\nA free catalog listing aeronautical charts and related\\npublications including prices and instructions for\\nordering is available at the National Aeronautical\\nCharting Office (NACO) Web site: www.naco.faa.gov.\\nSECTIONAL CHARTS\\nSectional charts are the most common charts used\\nby pilots today. The charts have a scale of 1:500,000\\n(1 inch = 6.86 nautical miles or approximately 8\\nstatute miles) which allows for more detailed infor-\\nmation to be included on the chart.\\nThe charts provide an abundance of information,\\nincluding airport data, navigational aids, airspace,\\nand topography. Figure 14-1 on the next page is an\\nexcerpt from the legend of a sectional chart. By\\nreferring to the chart legend, a pilot can interpret\\nmost of the information on the chart.

These charts\\nare similar to sectional charts and the symbols are the\\nsame except there is less detail due to the smaller scale.\\nThese charts are revised annually except several\\nAlaskan charts and the Mexican/Caribbean charts\\nwhich are revised every 2 years.\\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE\\n(MERIDIANS AND PARALLELS)\\nThe Equator is an imaginary circle equidistant from the\\npoles of the Earth. Circles parallel to the Equator (lines\\nrunning east and west) are parallels of latitude. They\\nare used to measure degrees of latitude north or south\\nof the Equator. The angular distance from the Equator\\nto the pole is one-fourth of a circle or 90°. The 48 con-\\nterminous states of the United States are located\\nbetween 25° and 49° N. latitude. The arrows in figure\\n14-2 labeled “LATITUDE” point to lines of latitude.\\nMeridians of longitude are drawn from the North Pole\\nto the South Pole and are at right angles to the Equator.\\nThe “Prime Meridian” which passes through\\nGreenwich, England, is used as the zero line from\\nwhich measurements are made in degrees east and west\\nto 180°. The 48 conterminous states of the United\\nStates are between 67° and 125° W. Longitude. The\\narrows in figure 14-2 labeled “LONGITUDE” point to\\nlines of longitude.\\nAny specific geographical point can thus be located by\\nreference to its longitude and latitude. Washington, DC\\nfor example, is approximately 39° N. latitude, 77° W.\\nlongitude. Chicago is approximately 42° N. latitude,\\n88° W. longitude.\\nTIME ZONES\\nThe meridians are also useful for designating time\\nzones. A day is defined as the time required for the\\nEarth to make one complete rotation of 360°. Since the\\nday is divided into 24 hours, the Earth revolves at the\\nrate of 15° an hour. Noon is the time when the Sun is\\ndirectly above a meridian; to the west of that meridian\\nis morning, to the east is afternoon.\\nThe standard practice is to establish a time zone for\\neach 15° of longitude. This makes a difference of\\nexactly 1 hour between each zone. In the United States,\\nthere are four time zones. The time zones are Eastern\\n(75°), Central (90°), Mountain (105°), and Pacific\\n(120°). The dividing lines are somewhat irregular\\nFigure 14-1.

It is\\ncalled Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and is often\\nreferred to as Zulu time. UTC is the time at the 0° line\\nof longitude which passes through Greenwich,\\nEngland. All of the time zones around the world are\\nbased on this reference. To convert to this time, a pilot\\nshould do the following:\\nEastern Standard Time..........Add 5 hours\\nCentral Standard Time..........Add 6 hours\\nMountain Standard Time...... Add 7 hours\\nPacific Standard Time.......... Add 8 hours\\nFor daylight saving time, 1 hour should be subtracted\\nfrom the calculated times.\\nMEASUREMENT OF DIRECTION\\nBy using the meridians, direction from one point to\\nanother can be measured in degrees, in a clockwise\\ndirection from true north. To indicate a course to be fol-\\nlowed in flight, draw a line on the chart from the point\\nof departure to the destination and measure the angle\\nwhich this line forms with a meridian. Direction is\\nexpressed in degrees, as shown by the compass rose in\\nfigure 14-4.\\nBecause meridians converge toward the poles, course\\nmeasurement should be taken at a meridian near the\\nmidpoint of the course rather than at the point of depar-\\nture. The course measured on the chart is known as the\\ntrue course. This is the direction measured by reference\\nto a meridian or true north. It is the direction of\\nintended flight as measured in degrees clockwise from\\ntrue north. \\n11:00 AM 12: NOON 1:00 PM10:00 AM\\n120°\\n105°\\n90°\\n75°Pacific Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nMountain Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nCentral Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nEastern Standard\\nTime Meridian\\nFigure 14-3.

Usually, it is neces-\\nsary to head the airplane in a direction slightly different\\nfrom the true course to offset the effect of wind.\\nConsequently, numerical value of the true heading may\\nnot correspond with that of the true course. This will be\\ndiscussed more fully in subsequent sections in this\\nchapter. For the purpose of this discussion, assume a\\nno-wind condition exists under which heading and\\ncourse would coincide. Thus, for a true course of 065°,\\nthe true heading would be 065°. To use the compass\\naccurately, however, corrections must be made for\\nmagnetic variation and compass deviation.\\nVARIATION\\nVariation is the angle between true north and magnetic\\nnorth. It is expressed as east variation or west variation\\ndepending upon whether magnetic north (MN) is to the\\neast or west of true north (TN).\\nThe north magnetic pole is located close to 71° N. lati-\\ntude, 96° W. longitude and is about 1,300 miles from\\nthe geographic or true north pole, as indicated in figure\\n14-6. If the Earth were uniformly magnetized, the com-\\npass needle would point toward the magnetic pole, in\\nwhich case the variation between true north (as shown\\nby the geographical meridians) and magnetic north (as\\nshown by the magnetic meridians) could be measured\\nat any intersection of the meridians.\\nActually, the Earth is not uniformly magnetized. In the\\nUnited States, the needle usually points in the general\\ndirection of the magnetic pole, but it may vary in certain\\ngeographical localities by many degrees. Consequently,\\nthe exact amount of variation at thousands of selected\\nlocations in the United States has been carefully deter-\\nmined. The amount and the direction of variation, which\\nchange slightly from time to time, are shown on most\\naeronautical charts as broken magenta lines, called iso-\\ngonic lines, which connect points of equal magnetic\\nvariation. (The line connecting points at which there is\\nno variation between true north and magnetic north is\\nthe agonic line.) An isogonic chart is shown in figure\\n14-6. Minor bends and turns in the isogonic and agonic\\nlines are caused by unusual geological conditions\\naffecting magnetic forces in these areas.\\nOn the west coast of the United States, the compass\\nneedle points to the east of true north; on the east coast,\\nthe compass needle points to the west of true north.\\nZero degree variation exists on the agonic line, where\\nmagnetic north and true north coincide. This line runs\\nroughly west of the Great Lakes, south through\\nWisconsin, Illinois, western Tennessee, and along the\\nborder of Mississippi and Alabama. [Compare figures\\n14-7 and 14-8.]\\nBecause courses are measured in reference to geograph-\\nical meridians which point toward true north, and these\\ncourses are maintained by reference to the compass\\nwhich points along a magnetic meridian in the general\\ndirection of magnetic north, the true direction must be\\nconverted into magnetic direction for the purpose of\\nflight. This conversion is made by adding or subtracting\\nthe variation which is indicated by the nearest isogonic\\nline on the chart. The true heading, when corrected for\\nvariation, is known as magnetic heading.\\nIf the variation is shown as “9°E,” this means that mag-\\nnetic north is 9° east of true north. If a true heading of\\n360° is to be flown, 9° must be subtracted from 360°,\\nwhich results in a magnetic heading of 351°.

To fly south, the magnetic heading would be\\n171° (180° – 9°). To fly west, it would be 261° (270° –\\n9°). To fly a true heading of 060°, a magnetic heading\\nof 051° (060° – 9°) would be flown.\\nRemember, to convert true course or heading to mag-\\nnetic course or heading, note the variation shown by\\nthe nearest isogonic line. If variation is west, add; if\\neast, subtract. One method for remembering whether to\\nadd or subtract variation is the phrase “east is least\\n(subtract) and west is best (add).”\\nDEVIATION\\nDetermining the magnetic heading is an intermediate\\nstep necessary to obtain the correct compass heading\\nfor the flight. To determine compass heading, a correc-\\ntion for deviation must be made. Because of magnetic\\ninfluences within the airplane such as electrical cir-\\ncuits, radio, lights, tools, engine, and magnetized metal\\nparts, the compass needle is frequently deflected from\\nits normal reading. This deflection is deviation. The\\ndeviation is different for each airplane, and it also may\\nvary for different headings in the same airplane. For\\ninstance, if magnetism in the engine attracts the north\\nend of the compass, there would be no effect when the\\nplane is on a heading of magnetic north. On easterly or\\nwesterly headings, however, the compass indications\\nwould be in error, as shown in figure 14-9. Magnetic\\nattraction can come from many other parts of the air-\\nplane; the assumption of attraction in the engine is\\nmerely used for the purpose of illustration.\\nSome adjustment of the compass, referred to as com-\\npensation, can be made to reduce this error, but the\\nremaining correction must be applied by the pilot.\\nProper compensation of the compass is best performed\\nby a competent technician. Since the magnetic forces\\nwithin the airplane change, because of landing shocks,\\nvibration, mechanical work, or changes in equipment,\\nthe pilot should occasionally have the deviation of the\\ncompass checked. The procedure used to check the\\ndeviation (called “swinging the compass”) is briefly\\noutlined.\\nThe airplane is placed on a magnetic compass rose, the\\nengine started, and electrical devices normally used\\n(such as radio) are turned on. Tailwheel-type airplanes\\nshould be jacked up into flying position.

For example, if the pilot needed the\\ncorrection for 195° and noted the correction for 180° to\\nbe 0° and for 210° to be +2°, it could be assumed that\\nthe correction for 195° would be +1°. The magnetic\\nheading, when corrected for deviation, is known as\\ncompass heading.\\nThe following method is used by many pilots to deter-\\nmine compass heading: After the true course (TC) is\\nmeasured, and wind correction applied resulting in a true\\nheading (TH), the sequence TH ± variation (V) = MH ±\\ndeviation (D) = compass heading (CH) is followed to\\narrive at compass heading. [Figure 14-11]\\nEFFECT OF WIND\\nThe preceding discussion explained how to measure a\\ntrue course on the aeronautical chart and how to make\\ncorrections for variation and deviation, but one\\nimportant factor has not been considered—wind. As\\ndiscussed in the study of the atmosphere, wind is a\\nmass of air moving over the surface of the Earth in a\\ndefinite direction. When the wind is blowing from the\\nnorth at 25 knots, it simply means that air is moving\\nsouthward over the Earth’s surface at the rate of 25\\nnautical miles (NM) in 1 hour.\\nUnder these conditions, any inert object free from con-\\ntact with the Earth will be carried 25 NM southward in\\n1 hour. This effect becomes apparent when such things\\nas clouds, dust, and toy balloons are observed being\\nblown along by the wind. Obviously, an airplane flying\\nwithin the moving mass of air will be similarly\\naffected. Even though the airplane does not float freely\\nwith the wind, it moves through the air at the same time\\nthe air is moving over the ground, thus is affected by\\nwind. Consequently, at the end of 1 hour of flight, the\\nairplane will be in a position which results from a com-\\nbination of these two motions:\\n• the movement of the air mass in reference to the\\nground, and\\n• the forward movement of the airplane through the\\nair mass.\\nActually, these two motions are independent. So far as\\nthe airplane’s flight through the air is concerned, it\\nmakes no difference whether the mass of air through\\nwhich the airplane is flying is moving or is stationary.\\nA pilot flying in a 70-knot gale would be totally\\nunaware of any wind (except for possible turbulence)\\nunless the ground were observed. In reference to the\\nground, however, the airplane would appear to fly\\nfaster with a tailwind or slower with a headwind, or to\\ndrift right or left with a crosswind.\\nAs shown in figure 14-12, an airplane flying eastward\\nat an airspeed of 120 knots in still air, will have a\\ngroundspeed exactly the same—120 knots. If the mass\\nof air is moving eastward at 20 knots, the airspeed of\\nthe airplane will not be affected, but the progress of the\\nairplane over the ground will be 120 plus 20, or a\\ngroundspeed of 140 knots. On the other hand, if the\\nmass of air is moving westward at 20 knots, the air-\\nspeed of the airplane still remains the same, but\\ngroundspeed becomes 120 minus 20 or 100 knots.\\nFigure 14-10.

It will be 20 miles south because of the motion of\\nthe air. Under these circumstances, the airspeed\\nremains 120 knots, but the groundspeed is determined\\nby combining the movement of the airplane with that\\nof the air mass. Groundspeed can be measured as the\\ndistance from the point of departure to the position of\\nthe airplane at the end of 1 hour. The groundspeed can\\nbe computed by the time required to fly between two\\npoints a known distance apart. It also can be deter-\\nmined before flight by constructing a wind triangle,\\nwhich will be explained later in this chapter. [Figure\\n14-13]\\nThe direction in which the plane is pointing as it flies is\\nheading. Its actual path over the ground, which is a\\ncombination of the motion of the airplane and the\\nmotion of the air, is track. The angle between the head-\\ning and the track is drift angle. If the airplane’s heading\\ncoincides with the true course and the wind is blowing\\nfrom the left, the track will not coincide with the true\\ncourse. The wind will drift the airplane to the right, so\\nthe track will fall to the right of the desired course or\\ntrue course. [Figure 14-14]\\nBy determining the amount of drift, the pilot can\\ncounteract the effect of the wind and make the track\\nof the airplane coincide with the desired course. If the\\nmass of air is moving across the course from the left,\\nthe airplane will drift to the right, and a correction\\nmust be made by heading the airplane sufficiently to\\nthe left to offset this drift. To state in another way, if\\nthe wind is from the left, the correction will be made\\nby pointing the airplane to the left a certain number of\\ndegrees, therefore correcting for wind drift. This is\\nwind correction angle and is expressed in terms of\\ndegrees right or left of the true course.

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60\\n(60 minutes = 1 hour). Thus, 30 minutes 30/60 = 0.5\\nhour. To convert hours to minutes, multiply by 60.\\nThus, 0.75 hour equals 0.75 x 60 = 45 minutes.\\nTime T = D/GS\\nTo find the time (T) in flight, divide the distance (D)\\nby the groundspeed (GS). The time to fly 210 nautical\\nmiles at a groundspeed of 140 knots is 210 divided by\\n140, or 1.5 hours. (The 0.5 hour multiplied by 60 min-\\nutes equals 30 minutes.) Answer: 1:30.\\nDistance D = GS X T\\nTo find the distance flown in a given time, multiply\\ngroundspeed by time. The distance flown in 1 hour 45\\nminutes at a groundspeed of 120 knots is 120 x 1.75, or\\n210 nautical miles.\\nGroundspeed GS = D/T\\nTo find the groundspeed, divide the distance flown by\\nthe time required. If an airplane flies 270 nautical miles\\nin 3 hours, the groundspeed is 270 divided by 3 = 90\\nknots.\\nCONVERTING KNOTS TO MILES PER HOUR\\nAnother conversion is that of changing knots to miles\\nper hour. The aviation industry is using knots more\\nfrequently than miles per hour, but it might be well to\\ndiscuss the conversion for those who do use miles per\\nhour when working with speed problems. The\\nNational Weather Service reports both surface winds\\nand winds aloft in knots. However, airspeed indica-\\ntors in some airplanes are calibrated in miles per hour\\n(although many are now calibrated in both miles per\\nhour and knots). Pilots, therefore, should learn to\\nconvert windspeeds in knots to miles per hour.\\nA knot is 1 nautical mile per hour. Because there are\\n6,076.1 feet in a nautical mile and 5,280 feet in a statute\\nmile, the conversion factor is 1.15. To convert knots to\\nmiles per hour, multiply knots by 1.15. For example: a\\nwindspeed of 20 knots is equivalent to 23 miles per\\nhour.\\nMost flight computers or electronic calculators have a\\nmeans of making this conversion. Another quick\\nmethod of conversion is to use the scales of nautical\\nmiles and statute miles at the bottom of aeronautical\\ncharts.\\nFUEL CONSUMPTION\\nAirplane fuel consumption is computed in gallons per\\nhour. Consequently, to determine the fuel required for a\\ngiven flight, the time required for the flight must be\\nknown. Time in flight multiplied by rate of consump-\\ntion gives the quantity of fuel required. For example, a\\nflight of 400 NM at a groundspeed of 100 knots\\nrequires 4 hours. If the plane consumes 5 gallons an\\nhour, the total consumption will be 4 x 5, or 20 gallons.\\nThe rate of fuel consumption depends on many factors:\\ncondition of the engine, propeller pitch, propeller\\nr.p.m., richness of the mixture, and particularly the per-\\ncentage of horsepower used for flight at cruising speed.\\nThe pilot should know the approximate consumption\\nrate from cruise performance charts, or from experi-\\nence. In addition to the amount of fuel required for the\\nflight, there should be sufficient fuel for reserve.\\nFLIGHT COMPUTERS\\nUp to this point, only mathematical formulas have been\\nused to determine such items as time, distance, speed,\\nand fuel consumption. In reality, most pilots will use a\\nmechanical or electronic flight computer. These devices\\ncan compute numerous problems associated with flight\\nplanning and navigation. The mechanical or electronic\\ncomputer will have an instruction book and most likely\\nsample problems so the pilot can become familiar with\\nits functions and operation. [Figure 14-16]\\nPLOTTER\\nAnother aid in flight planning is a plotter, which is a\\nprotractor and ruler. The pilot can use this when\\ndetermining true course and measuring distance.\\nMost plotters have a ruler which measures in both\\n14-8\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-8'),\n",

[Figure 14-16]\\nPILOTAGE\\nPilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks or\\ncheckpoints. It is a method of navigation that can be\\nused on any course that has adequate checkpoints, but\\nit is more commonly used in conjunction with dead\\nreckoning and VFR radio navigation.\\nThe checkpoints selected should be prominent features\\ncommon to the area of the flight. Choose checkpoints\\nthat can be readily identified by other features such as\\nroads, rivers, railroad tracks, lakes, and power lines. If\\npossible, select features that will make useful bound-\\naries or brackets on each side of the course, such as\\nhighways, rivers, railroads, and mountains. A pilot can\\nkeep from drifting too far off course by referring to and\\nnot crossing the selected brackets. Never place com-\\nplete reliance on any single checkpoint. Choose ample\\ncheckpoints. If one is missed, look for the next one\\nwhile maintaining the heading. When determining\\nposition from checkpoints, remember that the scale of a\\nsectional chart is 1 inch = 8 statute miles or 6.86 nauti-\\ncal miles. For example, if a checkpoint selected was\\napproximately one-half inch from the course line on\\nthe chart, it is 4 statue miles or 3.43 nautical miles from\\nthe course on the ground. In the more congested areas,\\nsome of the smaller features are not included on the\\nchart. If confused, hold the heading. If a turn is made\\naway from the heading, it will be easy to become lost.\\nRoads shown on the chart are primarily the well-trav-\\neled roads or those most apparent when viewed from\\nthe air. New roads and structures are constantly being\\nbuilt, and may not be shown on the chart until the next\\nchart is issued. Some structures, such as antennas may\\nbe difficult to see. Sometimes TV antennas are grouped\\ntogether in an area near a town. They are supported by\\nalmost invisible guy wires. Never approach an area of\\nantennas less than 500 feet above the tallest one. Most\\nof the taller structures are marked with strobe lights to\\nmake them more visible to a pilot. However, some\\nweather conditions or background lighting may make\\nthem difficult to see. Aeronautical charts display the\\nbest information available at the time of printing, but a\\npilot should be cautious for new structures or changes\\nthat have occurred since the chart was printed.\\nDEAD RECKONING\\nDead reckoning is navigation solely by means of\\ncomputations based on time, airspeed, distance, and\\ndirection. The products derived from these variables,\\nwhen adjusted by windspeed and velocity, are head-\\ning and groundspeed. The predicted heading will\\nguide the airplane along the intended path and the\\ngroundspeed will establish the time to arrive at each\\ncheckpoint and the destination. Except for flights\\nover water, dead reckoning is usually used with\\npilotage for cross-country flying. The heading and\\ngroundspeed as calculated is constantly monitored\\nand corrected by pilotage as observed from check-\\npoints.\\nTHE WIND TRIANGLE OR\\nVECTOR ANALYSIS\\nIf there is no wind, the airplane’s ground track will be\\nthe same as the heading and the groundspeed will be\\nthe same as the true airspeed. This condition rarely\\nexists. A wind triangle, the pilot’s version of vector\\nanalysis, is the basis of dead reckoning.\\nThe wind triangle is a graphic explanation of the\\neffect of wind upon flight. Groundspeed, heading, and\\ntime for any flight can be determined by using the\\nwind triangle. It can be applied to the simplest kind of\\ncross-country flight as well as the most complicated\\ninstrument flight. The experienced pilot becomes so\\nfamiliar with the fundamental principles that esti-\\nmates can be made which are adequate for visual\\nflight without actually drawing the diagrams. The\\nbeginning student, however, needs to develop skill in\\nconstructing these diagrams as an aid to the complete\\nunderstanding of wind effect. Either consciously or\\nunconsciously, every good pilot thinks of the flight in\\nterms of wind triangle.\\nIf a flight is to be made on a course to the east, with a\\nwind blowing from northeast, the airplane must be\\nheaded somewhat to the north of east to counteract\\ndrift. This can be represented by a diagram as shown in\\nfigure 14-17. Each line represents direction and speed.\\nThe long dotted line shows the direction the plane is\\nheading, and its length represents the airspeed for 1\\nhour.

The solid line shows the direction of the\\ntrack, or the path of the airplane as measured over the\\nEarth, and its length represents the distance traveled in\\n1 hour, or the groundspeed.\\nIn actual practice, the triangle illustrated in figure 14-17\\nis not drawn; instead, construct a similar triangle as\\nshown by the black lines in figure 14-18, which is\\nexplained in the following example.\\nSuppose a flight is to be flown from E to P. Draw a line\\non the aeronautical chart connecting these two points;\\nmeasure its direction with a protractor, or plotter, in ref-\\nerence to a meridian. This is the true course, which in\\nthis example is assumed to be 090° (east). From the\\nNational Weather Service, it is learned that the wind at\\nthe altitude of the intended flight is 40 knots from the\\nnortheast (045°). Since the National Weather Service\\nreports the windspeed in knots, if the true airspeed of\\nthe airplane is 120 knots, there is no need to convert\\nspeeds from knots to miles per hour or vice versa.\\nNow on a plain sheet of paper draw a vertical line rep-\\nresenting north and south. (The various steps are shown\\nin figure 14-19.)\\nPlace the protractor with the base resting on the verti-\\ncal line and the curved edge facing east. At the center\\npoint of the base, make a dot labeled “E” (point of\\ndeparture), and at the curved edge, make a dot at 90°\\n(indicating the direction of the true course) and another\\nat 45° (indicating wind direction).\\nWith the ruler, draw the true course line from E,\\nextending it somewhat beyond the dot by 90°, and\\nlabeling it “TC 090°.”\\nNext, align the ruler with E and the dot at 45°, and draw\\nthe wind arrow from E, not toward 045°, but downwind\\nin the direction the wind is blowing, making it 40 units\\nlong, to correspond with the wind velocity of 40 knots.\\nIdentify this line as the wind line by placing the letter\\n“W” at the end to show the wind direction. Finally,\\nmeasure 120 units on the ruler to represent the airspeed,\\nmaking a dot on the ruler at this point. The units used\\nmay be of any convenient scale or value (such as \\n1/4 inch\\n= 10 knots), but once selected, the same scale must be\\nused for each of the linear movements involved. Then\\nplace the ruler so that the end is on the arrowhead (W)\\nand the 120-knot dot intercepts the true course line.\\nDraw the line and label it “AS 120.” The point “P”\\nplaced at the intersection represents the position of the\\nairplane at the end of 1 hour.

The\\nfollowing sections will provide a logical sequence to\\nfollow in charting the course, filling out a flight log,\\nand filing a flight plan. In the following example, a trip\\nis planned based on the following data and the sectional\\nchart excerpt in figure 14-23.\\nRoute of flight: Chickasha Airport direct to Guthrie\\nAirport\\nTrue Airspeed (TAS)...............................115 knots\\nWinds Aloft.....................................360° at 10 knots\\nUsable fuel...........................................38 gallons\\nFuel Rate....................................................8 GPH\\nDeviation.............................................................+2°\\nSTEPS IN CHARTING THE COURSE\\nThe following is a suggested sequence for arriving at\\nthe pertinent information for the trip. As information is\\ndetermined, it may be noted as illustrated in the exam-\\nple of a flight log in figure 14-24. Where calculations\\nare required, the pilot may use a mathematical formula\\nor a manual or electronic flight computer. If unfamiliar\\nwith how to use a manual or electronic computer com-\\npetently, it would be advantageous to read the opera-\\ntion manual and work several practice problems at this\\npoint.\\nFirst draw a line from Chickasha Airport (point A)\\ndirectly to Guthrie Airport (point F). The course line\\nshould begin at the center of the airport of departure\\nand end at the center of the destination airport. If the\\nroute is direct, the course line will consist of a single\\nstraight line. If the route is not direct, it will consist of\\ntwo or more straight line segments—for example, a\\nVOR station which is off the direct route, but which\\nwill make navigating easier, may be chosen (radio nav-\\nigation is discussed later in this chapter).\\nAppropriate checkpoints should be selected along the\\nroute and noted in some way. These should be easy-to-\\nlocate points such as large towns, large lakes and rivers,\\nor combinations of recognizable points such as towns\\nwith an airport, towns with a network of highways, and\\nrailroads entering and departing. Normally, choose\\nonly towns indicated by splashes of yellow on the\\nchart. Do not choose towns represented by a small cir-\\ncle—these may turn out to be only a half-dozen houses.\\n(In isolated areas, however, towns represented by a\\nsmall circle can be prominent checkpoints.) For this\\ntrip, four checkpoints have been selected. Checkpoint 1\\nconsists of a tower located east of the course and can be\\nfurther identified by the highway and railroad track,\\nwhich almost parallels the course at this point.\\nCheckpoint 2 is the obstruction just to the west of the\\ncourse and can be further identified by Will Rogers\\nAirport which is directly to the east. Checkpoint 3 is\\nWiley Post Airport, which the airplane should fly\\ndirectly over. Checkpoint 4 is a private non-surfaced\\nairport to the west of the course and can be further iden-\\ntified by the railroad track and highway to the east of\\nthe course.\\nThe course and areas on either side of the planned route\\nshould be checked to determine if there is any type of\\nairspace with which the pilot should be concerned or\\nwhich has special operational requirements. For this\\ntrip, it should be noted that the course will pass through\\na segment of the Class C airspace surrounding Will\\nRogers Airport where the floor of the airspace is 2,500\\nfeet mean sea level (MSL) and the ceiling is 5,300 feet\\nMSL (point B). Also, there is Class D airspace from the\\nsurface to 3,800 feet MSL surrounding Wiley Post\\nAirport (point C) during the time the control tower is in\\noperation.\\nStudy the terrain and obstructions along the route.\\nThis is necessary to determine the highest and lowest\\nelevations as well as the highest obstruction to be\\nencountered so that an appropriate altitude which will\\nconform to part 91 regulations can be selected. If the\\nflight is to be flown at an altitude more than 3,000 feet\\nabove the terrain, conformance to the cruising altitude\\nappropriate to the direction of flight is required.\\nCheck the route for particularly rugged terrain so it\\ncan be avoided. Areas where a takeoff or landing will\\nbe made should be carefully checked for tall obstruc-\\ntions. TV transmitting towers may extend to altitudes\\nover 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain. It is\\nessential that pilots be aware of their presence and\\nlocation. For this trip, it should be noted that the\\ntallest obstruction is part of a series of antennas with a\\nheight of 2,749 feet MSL (point D). The highest ele-\\nvation should be located in the northeast quadrant and\\nis 2,900 feet MSL (point E).\\nSince the wind is no factor and it is desirable and within\\nthe airplane’s capability to fly above the Class C and D\\nairspace to be encountered, an altitude of 5,500 feet\\nMSL will be chosen. This altitude also gives adequate\\nclearance of all obstructions as well as conforms to the\\npart 91 requirement to fly at an altitude of odd thou-\\nsand plus 500 feet when on a magnetic course between\\n0 and 179°.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-14'),\n",

The\\ntotal distance is 53 NM and the distance between check-\\npoints is as noted on the flight log in figure 14-24.\\nAfter determining the distance, the true course should\\nbe measured. If using a plotter, follow the directions on\\nthe plotter. The true course is 031°. Once the true head-\\ning is established, the pilot can determine the compass\\nheading. This is done by following the formula given\\nearlier in this chapter. The formula is:\\nTC ± WCA = TH ± V AR = MH ± DEV = CH\\nThe wind correction angle can be determined by using\\na manual or electronic flight computer. Using a wind of\\n360° at 10 knots, it is determined the WCA is 3° left.\\nThis is subtracted from the TC making the TH 28°.\\nNext, the pilot should locate the isogonic line closest to\\nthe route of the flight to determine variation. Point G in\\nfigure 14-23 shows the variation to be 6° 30 �E\\n(rounded to 7°E), which means it should be subtracted\\nfrom the TH, giving an MH of 21°. Next, add 2° to the\\nMH for the deviation correction. This gives the pilot\\nthe compass heading which is 23°.\\nNext, the groundspeed should be determined. This can\\nbe done using a manual or electronic calculator. It is\\ndetermined the GS is 106 knots. Based on this infor-\\nmation, the total trip time, as well as time between\\ncheckpoints, and the fuel burned can be determined.\\nThese calculations can be done mathematically or by\\nusing a manual or electronic calculator.\\nFor this trip, the GS is 106 knots and the total time is\\n35 minutes (30 minutes plus 5 minutes for climb) with\\na fuel burn of 4.7 gallons. Refer to the flight log in fig-\\nure 14-24 for the time between checkpoints.\\nAs the trip progresses, the pilot can note headings and\\ntime and make adjustments in heading, groundspeed,\\nand time.\\nFILING A VFR FLIGHT PLAN\\nFiling a flight plan is not required by regulations;\\nhowever, it is a good operating practice, since the\\ninformation contained in the flight plan can be used in\\nsearch and rescue in the event of an emergency.\\nFlight plans can be filed in the air by radio, but it is best\\nto file a flight plan either in person at the FSS or by\\nphone just before departing. After takeoff, contact the\\nFSS by radio and give them the takeoff time so the\\nflight plan can be activated.\\nPILOT'S PLANNING SHEET\\nFUEL\\nRATE\\nTOTAL\\nFUELCOURSE TC WIND\\nKNOTS FROM\\nWCA\\nR+ L- TH VAR\\nW+ E- MH DEV CH TOTAL\\nMILES GS TOTAL\\nTIME\\nPLANE IDENTIFICATION N123DB DATE\\nFrom:\\nTo:\\nFrom:\\nTo:\\nChickasha\\nGuthrie 031˚ 10 360˚ 3˚ L 28 7˚ E 21˚ +2˚ 23 53 106kts 35 min 8 GPH 38 gal\\nVISUAL FLIGHT LOG\\nNAVIGATION\\nAIDS\\nTIME OF\\nDEPARTURE COURSE DISTANCE ELAPSED\\nTIME GS CH REMARKS\\nPOINT OF\\nDEPARTURE\\nNAVAID\\nIDENT.\\nFREQ.\\nWEATHER\\nAIRSPACE ETC.\\nCHECKPOINTS\\nDESTINATION\\nTO\\nFROM\\nPOINT\\nTO POINT\\nCUMULATIVE\\nESTIMATED\\nACTUAL\\nESTIMATED\\nACTU\\nAL\\nESTIMAT\\nED\\nACT\\nUAL\\n#1\\n#2\\n#3\\n#4\\nGuthrie Airport\\nChickasha Airport\\n11 NM\\n10NM\\n21 NM\\n10.5 NM\\n31.5 NM\\n13 NM\\n44.5 NM\\n8.5 NM\\n53 NM\\n6 MIN\\n+5\\n6 MIN\\n6 MIN\\n7 MIN\\n5 MIN\\n106 kts\\n106 kts\\n106 kts\\n106 kts\\n023˚\\n023˚\\n023˚\\n023˚\\nFigure 14-24.

These are:\\nVHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)\\nNondirectional Radiobeacon (NDB)\\nLong Range Navigation (LORAN-C)\\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)\\nVERY HIGH FREQUENCY (VHF)\\nOMNIDIRECTIONAL RANGE (VOR)\\nThe VOR system is present in three slightly differ-\\nent navigation aids (NAVAIDs): VOR, VOR/DME,\\nand VORTAC. By itself it is known as a VOR, and it\\nprovides magnetic bearing information to and from\\nthe station. When DME is also installed with a\\nVOR, the NAVAID is referred to as a VOR/DME.\\nWhen military tactical air navigation (TACAN)\\nequipment is installed with a VOR, the NAVAID is\\nknown as a VORTAC. DME is always an integral\\npart of a VORTAC. Regardless of the type of\\nNAVAID utilized (VOR, VOR/DME or VORTAC),\\nthe VOR indicator behaves the same. Unless other-\\nwise noted, in this section, VOR, VOR/DME and\\nVORTAC NAVAIDs will all be referred to hereafter\\nas VORs.\\nThe word “omni” means all, and an omnidirectional\\nrange is a VHF radio transmitting ground station that\\nprojects straight line courses (radials) from the station\\nin all directions. From a top view, it can be visualized\\nas being similar to the spokes from the hub of a wheel.\\nThe distance VOR radials are projected depends upon\\nthe power output of the transmitter.\\nThe course or radials projected from the station are\\nreferenced to magnetic north. Therefore, a radial is\\ndefined as a line of magnetic bearing extending out-\\nward from the VOR station. Radials are identified by\\nnumbers beginning with 001, which is 1° east of\\nmagnetic north, and progress in sequence through all\\nthe degrees of a circle until reaching 360. To aid in\\norientation, a compass rose reference to magnetic\\nnorth is superimposed on aeronautical charts at the\\nstation location.\\nVOR ground stations transmit within a VHF frequency\\nband of 108.0 – 117.95 MHz. Because the equipment is\\nVHF, the signals transmitted are subject to line-of-sight\\nrestrictions. Therefore, its range varies in direct propor-\\ntion to the altitude of receiving equipment. Generally,\\nthe reception range of the signals at an altitude of 1,000\\nfeet above ground level (AGL) is about 40 to 45 miles.\\nThis distance increases with altitude. [Figure 14-26]\\nVORs and VORTACs are classed according to opera-\\ntional use. There are three classes:\\nT (Terminal)\\nL (Low altitude)\\nH (High altitude)\\nThe normal useful range for the various classes is\\nshown in the following table:\\nVOR/VORTAC NA V AIDS\\nNormal Usable Altitudes and Radius Distances\\nDistance\\nClass Altitudes (Miles)\\nT 12,000’ and below 25\\nL Below 18,000’ 40\\nH Below 14,500’ 40\\nH Within the conterminous 48 states\\nonly, between 14,500 and 17,999’ 100\\nH 18,000’ – FL 450 130\\nH FL 450 – 60,000’ 100\\nThe useful range of certain facilities may be less than\\n50 miles.

This is particularly true at great distances\\nfrom the VOR station. The best assurance of main-\\ntaining an accurate VOR receiver is periodic checks\\nand calibrations. VOR accuracy checks are not a reg-\\nulatory requirement for VFR flight. However, to\\nassure accuracy of the equipment, these checks should\\nbe accomplished quite frequently along with a com-\\nplete calibration each year. The following means are\\nprovided for pilots to check VOR accuracy:\\n• FAA VOR test facility (VOT);\\n• certified airborne checkpoints;\\n• certified ground checkpoints located on airport sur-\\nfaces.\\nIf dual VOR is installed in the airplane and tuned to the\\nsame VOR ground facility, the maximum permissible\\nvariation between the two indicated bearings is 4°.\\nA list of these checkpoints is published in the\\nAirport/Facility Directory.\\nBasically, these checks consist of verifying that the\\nVOR radials the airplane equipment receives are\\naligned with the radials the station transmits. There are\\nnot specific tolerances in VOR checks required for\\nVFR flight. But as a guide to assure acceptable accu-\\nracy, the required IFR tolerances can be used which are\\n±4° for ground checks and ±6° for airborne checks.\\nThese checks can be performed by the pilot.\\nThe VOR transmitting station can be positively identi-\\nfied by its Morse code identification or by a recorded\\nvoice identification which states the name of the station\\nfollowed by the word “VOR.” Many Flight Service\\nStations transmit voice messages on the same frequency\\nthat the VOR operates. V oice transmissions should not\\nbe relied upon to identify stations, because many FSSs\\nremotely transmit over several omniranges, which have\\ndifferent names than the transmitting FSS. If the VOR is\\nout of service for maintenance, the coded identification\\nis removed and not transmitted. This serves to alert pilots\\nthat this station should not be used for navigation. VOR\\nreceivers are designed with an alarm flag to indicate\\nwhen signal strength is inadequate to operate the naviga-\\ntional equipment. This happens if the airplane is too far\\nfrom the VOR or the airplane is too low and therefore, is\\nout of the line-of-sight of the transmitting signals.\\nUSING THE VOR\\nIn review, for VOR radio navigation, there are two\\ncomponents required: the ground transmitter and the\\nairplane receiving equipment. The ground transmitter\\nis located at a specific position on the ground and trans-\\nmits on an assigned frequency. The airplane equipment\\nincludes a receiver with a tuning device and a VOR or\\nomninavigation instrument. The navigation instrument\\nconsists of (1) an omnibearing selector (OBS) some-\\ntimes referred to as the course selector, (2) a course\\ndeviation indicator needle (Left-Right Needle), and (3)\\na TO-FROM indicator.\\nThe course selector is an azimuth dial that can be\\nrotated to select a desired radial or to determine the\\nradial over which the airplane is flying. In addition, the\\nmagnetic course “TO” or “FROM” the station can be\\ndetermined.\\nWhen the course selector is rotated, it moves the course\\ndeviation indicator (CDI) or needle to indicate the posi-\\ntion of the radial relative to the airplane. If the course\\nselector is rotated until the deviation needle is centered,\\nthe radial (magnetic course “FROM” the station) or its\\nreciprocal (magnetic course “TO” the station) can be\\ndetermined. The course deviation needle will also\\nmove to the right or left if the airplane is flown or drift-\\ning away from the radial which is set in the course\\nselector.\\nBy centering the needle, the course selector will indi-\\ncate either the course “FROM” the station or the course\\n“TO” the station. If the flag displays a “TO,” the course\\nshown on the course selector must be flown to the sta-\\ntion.[Figure 14-27] If “FROM” is displayed and the\\ncourse shown is followed, the airplane will be flown\\naway from the station.\\n0\\n3\\n6\\n9\\n12\\n1518\\n21\\n24\\n27\\n30\\n33\\nTO\\nFR\\nOBS\\nFigure 14-27.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='14-20\\nTRACKING WITH VOR\\nThe following describes a step-by-step procedure to\\nuse when tracking to and from a VOR station. Figure\\n14-28 illustrates the discussion:\\nFirst, tune the VOR receiver to the frequency of the\\nselected VOR station. For example: 115.0 to receive\\nBravo VOR. Next, check the identifiers to verify that\\nthe desired VOR is being received. As soon as the VOR\\nis properly tuned, the course deviation needle will\\ndeflect either left or right; then rotate the azimuth dial\\nto the course selector until the course deviation needle\\ncenters and the TO-FROM indicates “TO.” If the nee-\\ndle centers with a “FROM” indication, the azimuth\\nshould be rotated 180° because, in this case, it is\\ndesired to fly “TO” the station. Now, turn the airplane\\nto the heading indicated on the VOR azimuth dial or\\ncourse selector. In this example 350°.\\nIf a heading of 350° is maintained with a wind from the\\nright as shown, the airplane will drift to the left of the\\nintended track. As the airplane drifts off course, the\\nVOR course deviation needle will gradually move to\\nthe right of center or indicate the direction of the\\ndesired radial or track.\\nTo return to the desired radial, the airplane heading\\nmust be altered to the right. As the airplane returns to\\nthe desired track, the deviation needle will slowly\\nreturn to center. When centered, the airplane will be on\\nthe desired radial and a left turn must be made toward,\\nbut not to the original heading of 350° because a wind\\ndrift correction must be established. The amount of cor-\\nrection depends upon the strength of the wind. If the\\nwind velocity is unknown, a trial and error method can\\nbe used to find the correct heading. Assume, for this\\nexample, a 10° correction or a heading of 360° is main-\\ntained.\\nWhile maintaining a heading of 360°, assume that the\\ncourse deviation begins to move to the left. This means\\nthat the wind correction of 10° is too great and the air-\\nplane is flying to the right of course. A slight turn to the\\nleft should be made to permit the airplane to return to\\nthe desired radial.\\nWhen the deviation needle centers, a small wind drift\\ncorrection of 5° or a heading correction of 355° should\\nbe flown. If this correction is adequate, the airplane\\nwill remain on the radial. If not, small variation in\\nheading should be made to keep the needle centered,\\nand consequently keep the airplane on the radial.\\nAs the VOR station is passed, the course deviation nee-\\ndle will fluctuate, then settle down, and the “TO” indi-\\ncation will change to “FROM.” If the airplane passes to\\none side of the station, the needle will deflect in the\\ndirection of the station as the indicator changes to\\n“FROM.”\\nGenerally, the same techniques apply when tracking\\noutbound as those used for tracking inbound. If the\\nintent is to fly over the station and track outbound on\\nthe reciprocal of the inbound radial, the course selector\\nshould not be changed. Corrections are made in the\\nsame manner to keep the needle centered. The only dif-\\nference is that the omni will indicate “FROM.”\\nIf tracking outbound on a course other than the recipro-\\ncal of the inbound radial, this new course or radial must\\nbe set in the course selector and a turn made to inter-\\ncept this course. After this course is reached, tracking\\nprocedures are the same as previously discussed.\\n350°\\nFROM\\n350°\\nFROM\\n040°\\nFROM\\n350°\\nTO\\n355°\\n040°\\n355°\\n355°\\n350°\\nTO\\n350°\\nTO\\n350°\\nTO\\n020°\\n350°\\n360°\\n360°\\n350°\\nTO\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.\\n4.\\n5.\\n6.\\n7.\\n8.\\nWIND\\nBRAVO\\nBRA 115.0\\n0\\n18\\n27\\n6\\nFigure 14-28.

If the airplane\\ndrifts, do not reset the course selector, but correct\\nfor drift and fly a heading that will compensate\\nfor wind drift.\\n• If minor needle fluctuations occur, avoid chang-\\ning headings immediately. Wait momentarily to\\nsee if the needle recenters; if it doesn’t, then\\ncorrect.\\n• When flying “TO” a station, always fly the\\nselected course with a “TO” indication. When fly-\\ning “FROM” a station, always fly the selected\\ncourse with a “FROM” indication. If this is not\\ndone, the action of the course deviation needle will\\nbe reversed. To further explain this reverse action,\\nif the airplane is flown toward a station with a\\n“FROM” indication or away from a station with a\\n“TO” indication, the course deviation needle will\\nindicate in an opposite direction to that which it\\nshould. For example, if the airplane drifts to the\\nright of a radial being flown, the needle will move\\nto the right or point away from the radial. If the\\nairplane drifts to the left of the radial being flown,\\nthe needle will move left or in the opposite direc-\\ntion of the radial.\\nDISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT\\nDistance measuring equipment (DME) is an ultra high\\nfrequency (UHF) navigational aid present with\\nVOR/DMEs and VORTACs. It measures, in nautical\\nmiles (NM), the slant range distance of an airplane\\nfrom a VOR/DME or VORTAC (both hereafter\\nreferred to as a VORTAC). Although DME equipment\\nis very popular, not all airplanes are DME equipped.\\nTo utilize DME, the pilot should select, tune, and iden-\\ntify a VORTAC, as previously described. The DME\\nreceiver, utilizing what is called a “paired frequency”\\nconcept, automatically selects and tunes the UHF DME\\nfrequency associated with the VHF VORTAC fre-\\nquency selected by the pilot. This process is entirely\\ntransparent to the pilot. After a brief pause, the DME\\ndisplay will show the slant range distance to or from\\nthe VORTAC. Slant range distance is the direct dis-\\ntance between the airplane and the VORTAC, and is\\ntherefore affected by airplane altitude. (Station passage\\ndirectly over a VORTAC from an altitude of 6,076 feet\\nabove ground level (AGL) would show approximately\\n1.0 NM on the DME.) DME is a very useful adjunct to\\nVOR navigation. A VOR radial alone merely gives line\\nof position information. With DME, a pilot may pre-\\ncisely locate the airplane on that line (radial).\\nMost DME receivers also provide groundspeed\\nand time-to-station modes of operation. The\\ngroundspeed is displayed in knots (NM per hour). The\\ntime-to-station mode displays the minutes\\nremaining to VORTAC station passage, predicated\\nupon the present groundspeed. Groundspeed and\\ntime-to-station information is only accurate when\\ntracking directly to or from a VORTAC. DME\\nreceivers typically need a minute or two of stabilized\\nflight directly to or from a VORTAC before dis-\\nplaying accurate groundspeed or time-to-station\\ninformation.\\nSome DME installations have a hold feature that per-\\nmits a DME signal to be retained from one VORTAC\\nwhile the course indicator displays course deviation\\ninformation from an ILS or another VORTAC.\\nVOR/DME RNAV\\nArea navigation (RNAV) permits electronic course\\nguidance on any direct route between points estab-\\nlished by the pilot. While RNA V is a generic term that\\napplies to a variety of navigational aids, such as\\nLORAN-C, GPS, and others, this section will deal\\nwith VOR/DME-based RNAV. VOR/DME RNAV is\\nnot a separate ground-based NA V AID, but a method of\\nnavigation using VOR/DME and VORTAC signals\\nspecially processed by the airplane’s RNA V computer. \\n[Figure 14-29] Note: In this section, the term “VORTAC” also\\nincludes VOR/DME NAVAIDs.\\nIn its simplest form, VOR/DME RNA V allows the pilot\\nto electronically move VORTACs around to more con-\\nvenient locations. Once electronically relocated, they are\\nreferred to as waypoints. These waypoints are described\\nas a combination of a selected radial and distance within\\nthe service volume of the VORTAC to be used. These\\nwaypoints allow a straight course to be flown between\\nalmost any origin and destination, without regard to the\\norientation of VORTACs or the existence of airways.\\nArea Navigation\\nDirect Route\\nFIGURE 14-29.

Pilots are\\nurged to study the manufacturer’s operating guide and\\nreceive instruction prior to the use of VOR/DME\\nRNAV or any unfamiliar navigational system.\\nOperational information and limitations should also be\\nsought from placards and the supplement section of the\\nAirplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating\\nHandbook (AFM/POH).\\nVOR/DME-based RNA V units operate in at least three\\nmodes: VOR, En Route, and Approach. A fourth mode,\\nVOR Parallel, may also be found on some models. The\\nunits need both VOR and DME signals to operate in\\nany RNAV mode. If the NAVAID selected is a VOR\\nwithout DME, RNA V mode will not function.\\nIn the VOR (or non-RNAV) mode, the unit simply\\nfunctions as a VOR receiver with DME capability.\\n[Figure 14-30] The unit’s display on the VOR indicator\\nis conventional in all respects. For operation on estab-\\nlished airways or any other ordinary VOR navigation,\\nthe VOR mode is used.\\nTo utilize the unit’s RNA V capability, the pilot selects\\nand establishes a waypoint or a series of waypoints to\\ndefine a course. To operate in any RNA V mode, the unit\\nneeds both radial and distance signals; therefore, a\\nVORTAC (or VOR/DME) needs to be selected as a\\nNA V AID. To establish a waypoint, a point somewhere\\nwithin the service range of a VORTAC is defined on\\nthe basis of radial and distance. Once the waypoint is\\nentered into the unit and the RNA V En Route mode is\\nselected, the CDI will display course guidance to the\\nwaypoint, not the original VORTAC. DME will also\\ndisplay distance to the waypoint. Many units have the\\ncapability to store several waypoints, allowing them to\\nbe programmed prior to flight, if desired, and called up\\nin flight.\\nRNA V waypoints are entered into the unit in magnetic\\nbearings (radials) of degrees and tenths (i.e., 275.5°)\\nand distances in nautical miles and tenths (i.e., 25.2\\nNM). When plotting RNA V waypoints on an aeronau-\\ntical chart, pilots will find it difficult to measure to that\\nlevel of accuracy, and in practical application, it is\\nrarely necessary. A number of flight planning publica-\\ntions publish airport coordinates and waypoints with\\nthis precision and the unit will accept those figures.\\nThere is a subtle, but important difference in CDI oper-\\nation and display in the RNA V modes.\\nIn the RNA V modes, course deviation is displayed in\\nterms of linear deviation. In the RNA V En Route mode,\\nmaximum deflection of the CDI typically represents 5\\nNM on either side of the selected course, without\\nregard to distance from the waypoint. In the RNAV\\nApproach mode, maximum deflection of the CDI typi-\\ncally represents 1 \\n1/4 NM on either side of the selected\\ncourse. There is no increase in CDI sensitivity as the\\nairplane approaches a waypoint in RNA V mode.\\nThe RNAV Approach mode is used for instrument\\napproaches. Its narrow scale width (one-quarter of the\\nEn Route mode) permits very precise tracking to or\\nfrom the selected waypoint. In visual flight rules (VFR)\\ncross-country navigation, tracking a course in the\\nApproach mode is not desirable because it requires a\\ngreat deal of attention and soon becomes tedious.\\nA fourth, lesser-used mode on some units is the\\nVOR Parallel mode. This permits the CDI to display\\nlinear (not angular) deviation as the airplane tracks\\nto and from VORTACs. It derives its name from per-\\nmitting the pilot to offset (or parallel) a selected\\ncourse or airway at a fixed distance of the pilot’s\\nchoosing, if desired. The VOR Parallel mode has the\\nsame effect as placing a waypoint directly over an\\nexisting VORTAC. Some pilots select the VOR\\nParallel mode when utilizing the navigation (NAV)\\ntracking function of their autopilot for smoother\\ncourse following near the VORTAC.\\nConfusion is possible when navigating an airplane\\nwith VOR/DME-based RNAV, and it is essential\\nthat the pilot become familiar with the equipment\\ninstalled. It is not unknown for pilots to operate\\ninadvertently in one of the RNAV modes when the\\noperation was not intended by overlooking switch\\npositions or annunciators. The reverse has also\\noccurred with a pilot neglecting to place the unit\\ninto one of the RNAV modes by overlooking switch\\npositions or annunciators. As always, the prudent\\npilot is not only familiar with the equipment used,\\nbut never places complete reliance in just one\\nmethod of navigation when others are available for\\ncross-check.\\nAUTOMATIC DIRECTION FINDER\\nMany general aviation-type airplanes are equipped\\nwith automatic direction finder (ADF) radio receiving\\nequipment. To navigate using the ADF, the pilot tunes\\nthe receiving equipment to a ground station known as a\\nNONDIRECTIONAL RADIOBEACON (NDB). The\\nNDB stations normally operate in a low or medium fre-\\nquency band of 200 to 415 kHz. The frequencies are\\nFIGURE 14-30. RNAV controls.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-22'),\n",

A compass locator, which\\nis associated with an Instrument Landing System,\\ntransmits a two-letter identification.\\nStandard broadcast stations can also be used in conjunc-\\ntion with ADF. Positive identification of all radio stations\\nis extremely important and this is particularly true when\\nusing standard broadcast stations for navigation.\\nNondirectional radiobeacons have one advantage\\nover the VOR. This advantage is that low or medium\\nfrequencies are not affected by line-of-sight. The\\nsignals follow the curvature of the Earth; therefore,\\nif the airplane is within the range of the station, the\\nsignals can be received regardless of altitude.\\nThe following table gives the class of NDB stations,\\ntheir power, and usable range:\\nNONDIRECTIONAL RADIOBEACON (NDB)\\n(Usable Radius Distances for All Altitudes)\\nClass Power(Watts) Distance\\n(Miles)\\nCompass Locator Under 25 15\\nMH Under 50 25\\nH 50 – 1999 *50\\nHH 2000 or more 75\\n*Service range of individual facilities may be less than\\n50 miles.\\nOne of the disadvantages that should be considered when\\nusing low frequency for navigation is that low-frequency\\nsignals are very susceptible to electrical disturbances,\\nsuch as lightning. These disturbances create excessive\\nstatic, needle deviations, and signal fades. There may be\\ninterference from distant stations. Pilots should know the\\nconditions under which these disturbances can occur so\\nthey can be more alert to possible interference when\\nusing the ADF.\\nBasically, the ADF airplane equipment consists of a\\ntuner, which is used to set the desired station frequency,\\nand the navigational display.\\nThe navigational display consists of a dial upon which\\nthe azimuth is printed, and a needle which rotates\\naround the dial and points to the station to which the\\nreceiver is tuned.\\nSome of the ADF dials can be rotated so as to align the\\nazimuth with the airplane heading; others are fixed\\nwith 0° representing the nose of the airplane, and 180°\\nrepresenting the tail. Only the fixed azimuth dial will\\nbe discussed in this handbook. [Figure 14-31]\\nFigure 14-32 illustrates the following terms that are used\\nwith the ADF and should be understood by the pilot.\\nRelative Bearing— is the value to which the indi-\\ncator (needle) points on the azimuth dial. When\\nusing a fixed dial, this number is relative to the\\nnose of the airplane and is the angle measured\\nclockwise from the nose of the airplane to a line\\ndrawn from the airplane to the station.\\nMagnetic Bearing—“ TO” the station is the angle\\nformed by a line drawn from the airplane to the sta-\\ntion and a line drawn from the airplane to magnetic\\nnorth. The magnetic bearing to the station can be\\ndetermined by adding the relative bearing to the\\nmagnetic heading of the airplane. For example, if\\nthe relative bearing is 060° and the magnetic head-\\ning is 130°, the magnetic bearing to the station is\\nFigure 14-31.

This means that in still air\\na magnetic heading of approximately 190° would\\nbe flown to the station. If the total is greater than\\n360°, subtract 360° from the total to obtain the\\nmagnetic bearing to the station. For example, if the\\nrelative bearing is 270° and magnetic heading is\\n300°, 360° is subtracted from the total, or 570° –\\n360° = 210°, which is the magnetic bearing to the\\nstation.\\nTo determine the magnetic bearing “FROM” the\\nstation, 180° is added to or subtracted from the\\nmagnetic bearing to the station. This is the reciprocal\\nbearing and is used when plotting position fixes.\\nKeep in mind that the needle of fixed azimuth points to\\nthe station in relation to the nose of the airplane. If the\\nneedle is deflected 30° to the left or a relative bearing\\nof 330°, this means that the station is located 30° left. If\\nthe airplane is turned left 30°, the needle will move to\\nthe right 30° and indicate a relative bearing of 0° or the\\nairplane will be pointing toward the station. If the pilot\\ncontinues flight toward the station keeping the needle\\non 0°, the procedure is called homing to the station. If a\\ncrosswind exists, the ADF needle will continue to drift\\naway from zero. To keep the needle on zero, the\\nairplane must be turned slightly resulting in a curved\\nflightpath to the station. Homing to the station is a\\ncommon procedure, but results in drifting downwind,\\nthus lengthening the distance to the station.\\nTracking to the station requires correcting for wind\\ndrift and results in maintaining flight along a straight\\ntrack or bearing to the station. When the wind drift cor-\\nrection is established, the ADF needle will indicate the\\namount of correction to the right or left. For instance, if\\nthe magnetic bearing to the station is 340°, a correction\\nfor a left crosswind would result in a magnetic heading\\nof 330°, and the ADF needle would indicate 10° to the\\nright or a relative bearing of 010°. [Figure 14-33]\\nWhen tracking away from the station, wind corrections\\nare made similar to tracking to the station, but the ADF\\nneedle points toward the tail of the airplane or the 180°\\nposition on the azimuth dial. Attempting to keep the\\nADF needle on the 180° position during winds results\\nin the airplane flying a curved flight leading further and\\nfurther from the desired track. To correct for wind when\\ntracking outbound, correction should be made in the\\ndirection opposite of that in which the needle\\nis pointing.\\nAlthough the ADF is not as popular as the VOR for\\nradio navigation, with proper precautions and\\nintelligent use, the ADF can be a valuable aid\\nto navigation.\\nLORAN-C NAVIGATION\\nLong Range Navigation, version C (LORAN-C) is\\nanother form of RNAV, but one that operates from\\nchains of transmitters broadcasting signals in the low\\nfrequency (LF) spectrum. World Aeronautical Chart\\n(WAC), Sectional Charts, and VFR Terminal Area\\nCharts do not show the presence of LORAN-C\\ntransmitters. Selection of a transmitter chain is either\\nmade automatically by the unit, or manually by the\\npilot using guidance information provided by the\\nmanufacturer. LORAN-C is a highly accurate, supple-\\nmental form of navigation typically installed as an\\nadjunct to VOR and ADF equipment. Databases of\\nairports, NA V AIDs, and air traffic control facilities are\\nfrequently features of LORAN-C receivers.\\nLORAN-C is an outgrowth of the original LORAN-A\\ndeveloped for navigation during World War II. The\\nLORAN-C system is used extensively in maritime\\napplications. It experienced a dramatic growth in\\npopularity with pilots with the advent of the small,\\npanel-mounted LORAN-C receivers available at\\nFigure 14-33.

These units are frequently very\\nsophisticated and capable, with a wide variety of\\nnavigational functions.\\nWith high levels of LORAN-C sophistication and\\ncapability, a certain complexity in operation is an\\nunfortunate necessity. Pilots are urged to read the\\noperating handbooks and to consult the supplements\\nsection of the AFM/POH prior to utilizing LORAN-C\\nfor navigation. Many units offer so many features that\\nthe manufacturers often publish two different sets of\\ninstructions:  (1) a brief operating guide and (2)\\nin-depth operating manual.\\nWhile coverage is not global, LORAN-C signals are\\nsuitable for navigation in all of the conterminous\\nUnited States, and parts of Canada and Alaska. Several\\nforeign countries also operate their own LORAN-C\\nsystems. In the United States, the U.S. Coast Guard\\noperates the LORAN-C system. LORAN-C system\\nstatus is available from:  USCG Navigation Center,\\nAlexandria, V A (703) 313-5900.\\nLORAN-C absolute accuracy is excellent—position\\nerrors are typically less than .25 NM. Repeatable\\naccuracy, or the ability to return to a waypoint\\npreviously visited, is even better. While LORAN-C is a\\nform of RNAV, it differs significantly from\\nVOR/DME-based RNA V . It operates in a 90 – 110 kHz\\nfrequency range and is based upon measurement of the\\ndifference in arrival times of pulses of radio frequency\\n(RF) energy emitted by a chain of transmitters\\nhundreds of miles apart.\\nWithin any given chain of transmitters, there is a\\nmaster station, and from three to five secondary\\nstations. LORAN-C units must be able to receive at\\nleast a master and two secondary stations to provide\\nnavigational information. Unlike VOR/DME-based\\nRNAV, where the pilot must select the appropriate\\nVOR/DME or VORTAC frequency, there is not a\\nfrequency selection in LORAN-C. The most advanced\\nunits automatically select the optimum chain for\\nnavigation. Other units rely upon the pilot to select the\\nappropriate chain with a manual entry.\\nAfter the LORAN-C receiver has been turned on, the\\nunit must be initialized before it can be used for\\nnavigation. While this can be accomplished in flight, it\\nis preferable to perform this task, which can take\\nseveral minutes, on the ground. The methods for\\ninitialization are as varied as the number of different\\nmodels of receivers. Some require pilot input during\\nthe process, such as verification or acknowledgment of\\nthe information displayed.\\nMost units contain databases of navigational\\ninformation. Frequently, such databases contain not\\nonly airport and NA V AID locations, but also extensive\\nairport, airspace, and ATC information. While the unit\\nwill operate with an expired database, the information\\nshould be current or verified to be correct prior to use.\\nThe pilot can update some databases, while others\\nrequire removal from the airplane and the services of\\nan avionics technician.\\nVFR navigation with LORAN-C can be as simple as\\ntelling the unit where the pilot wishes to go. The course\\nguidance provided will be a great circle (shortest\\ndistance) route to the destination. Older units may need\\na destination entered in terms of latitude and longitude,\\nbut recent designs only need the identifier of the airport\\nor NA V AID. The unit will also permit database storage\\nand retrieval of pilot defined waypoints. LORAN-C\\nsignals follow the curvature of the Earth and\\nare generally usable hundreds of miles from\\ntheir transmitters.\\nThe LORAN-C signal is subject to degradation from a\\nvariety of atmospheric disturbances. It is also\\nsusceptible to interference from static electricity\\nbuildup on the airframe and electrically “noisy”\\nairframe equipment. Flight in precipitation or even dust\\nclouds can cause occasional interference with\\nnavigational guidance from LORAN-C signals. To\\nminimize these effects, static wicks and bonding straps\\nshould be installed and properly maintained. \\nLORAN-C navigation information is presented to the\\npilot in a variety of ways. All units have self-contained\\ndisplays, and some elaborate units feature built-in\\nmoving map displays. Some installations can also drive\\nan external moving map display, a conventional VOR\\nindicator, or a horizontal situation indicator (HSI).\\nCourse deviation information is presented as a linear\\ndeviation from course—there is no increase in tracking\\nsensitivity as the airplane approaches the waypoint or\\ndestination.

Its RNA V guidance is\\nworldwide in scope. There are no symbols for GPS on\\naeronautical charts as it is a space-based system with\\nglobal coverage. Development of the system is\\nunderway so that GPS will be capable of providing the\\nprimary means of electronic navigation. Portable and\\nyoke mounted units are proving to be very popular in\\naddition to those permanently installed in the airplane.\\nExtensive navigation databases are common features in\\nairplane GPS receivers.\\nThe GPS is a satellite radio navigation and time\\ndissemination system developed and operated by the\\nU.S. Department of Defense (DOD). Civilian interface\\nand GPS system status is available from the U.S.\\nCoast Guard.\\nIt is not necessary to understand the technical aspects\\nof GPS operation to use it in VFR/instrument flight\\nrules (IFR) navigation. It does differ significantly from\\nconventional, ground-based electronic navigation, and\\nawareness of those differences is important. Awareness\\nof equipment approvals and limitations is critical to the\\nsafety of flight. The GPS system is composed of three\\nmajor elements:\\n1. The space segment is composed of a constella-\\ntion of 26 satellites orbiting approximately\\n10,900 NM above the Earth. The operational\\nsatellites are often referred to as the GPS\\nconstellation. The satellites are not\\ngeosynchronous but instead orbit the Earth in\\nperiods of approximately 12 hours. Each\\nsatellite is equipped with highly stable atomic\\nclocks and transmits a unique code and\\nnavigation message. Transmitting in the UHF\\nrange means that the signals are virtually\\nunaffected by weather although they are\\nsubject to line-of-sight limitations. The\\nsatellites must be above the horizon (as seen\\nby the receiver’s antenna) to be usable\\nfor navigation.\\n2. The control segment consists of a master\\ncontrol station at Falcon AFB, Colorado\\nSprings, CO, five monitor stations, and three\\nground antennas. The monitor stations and\\nground antennas are distributed around the\\nEarth to allow continual monitoring and\\ncommunications with the satellites. Updates\\nand corrections to the navigational message\\nbroadcast by each satellite are uplinked\\nto the satellites as they pass over the\\nground antennas.\\n3. The user segment consists of all components\\nassociated with the GPS receiver, ranging\\nfrom portable, hand-held receivers to receivers\\npermanently installed in the airplane. The\\nreceiver matches the satellite’s coded signal by\\nshifting its own identical code in a matching\\nprocess to precisely measure the time of\\narrival. Knowing the speed the signal traveled\\n(approximately 186,000 miles per second) and\\nthe exact broadcast time, the distance traveled\\nby the signal can be inferred from its\\narrival time.\\nTo solve for its location, the GPS receiver utilizes the\\nsignals of at least four of the best-positioned satellites\\nto yield a three-dimensional fix (latitude, longitude,\\nand altitude). A two-dimensional fix (latitude and\\nlongitude only) can be determined with as few as three\\nsatellites. GPS receivers have extensive databases.\\nDatabases are provided initially by the receiver\\nmanufacturer and updated by the manufacturer or a\\ndesignated data agency.\\nA wide variety of GPS receivers with extensive\\nnavigation capabilities are available. Panel mounted\\nunits permanently installed in the airplane may be used\\nfor VFR and may also have certain IFR approvals.\\nPortable hand-held and yoke mounted GPS receivers\\nare also popular, although these are limited to VFR use.\\nNot all GPS receivers on the market are suited for air\\nnavigation. Marine, recreational, and surveying units,\\nfor example, are not suitable for airplane use. As with\\nLORAN-C receivers, GPS unit features and operating\\nprocedures vary widely. The pilot must be familiar with\\nthe manufacturer’s operating guide. Placards,\\nswitch positions, and annunciators should be\\ncarefully observed.\\nInitialization of the unit will require several minutes\\nand should be accomplished prior to flight. If the unit\\nhas not been operated for several months or if it has\\nbeen moved to a significantly different location (by\\nseveral hundred miles) while off, this may require\\nseveral additional minutes. During initialization, the\\nunit will make internal integrity checks, acquire\\nsatellite signals, and display the database revision date.\\nWhile the unit will operate with an expired database,\\nthe database should be current, or verified to be\\ncorrect, prior to relying on it for navigation.\\nVFR navigation with GPS can be as simple as selecting\\na destination (an airport, VOR, NDB, intersection, or\\npilot defined waypoint) and placing the unit in the\\nnavigation mode. Course guidance provided will be a\\ngreat circle route (shortest distance) direct to the\\ndestination. Many units provide advisory information\\nabout special use airspace and minimum safe altitudes,\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-26'),\n",

Users having prior experience with\\nLORAN-C receivers will note many similarities in the\\nwealth of navigation information available, although\\nthe technical principles of operation are quite different.\\nAll GPS receivers have integral (built into the unit)\\nnavigation displays and some feature integral moving\\nmap displays. Some panel-mounted units will drive a\\nVOR indicator, HSI, or even an external moving map\\ndisplay. GPS course deviation is linear—there is not an\\nincrease in tracking sensitivity as the airplane\\napproaches a waypoint. Pilots must carefully observe\\nplacards, selector switch positions, and annunciator\\nindications when utilizing GPS as installations and\\napprovals can vary widely.\\nThe integral GPS navigation display (like most\\nLORAN-C units) uses several additional navigational\\nterms beyond those used in NDB and VOR navigation.\\nSome of these terms, whose abbreviations vary among\\nmanufacturers, are shown below. The pilot should\\nconsult the manufacturer’s operating guide for\\nspecific definitions.\\nNOTAMs should be reviewed prior to relying on GPS\\nfor navigation. GPS NOTAMs will be issued to\\nannounce outages for specific GPS satellites by\\npseudorandom noise code (PRN) and satellite vehicle\\nnumber (SVN). Pilots may obtain GPS NOTAMs from\\nFSS briefers only upon request.\\nWhen using any sophisticated and highly capable\\nnavigation system, such as LORAN-C or GPS, there is\\na strong temptation to rely almost exclusively on that\\nunit, to the detriment of using other techniques of\\nposition keeping. The prudent pilot will never rely on\\none means of navigation when others are available for\\ncross-check and backup.\\nLOST PROCEDURES\\nGetting lost in an airplane is a potentially dangerous\\nsituation especially when low on fuel. If a pilot\\nbecomes lost, there are some good common sense\\nprocedures to follow. If a town or city cannot be seen,\\nthe first thing to do is climb, being mindful of traffic\\nand weather conditions. An increase in altitude\\nincreases radio and navigation reception range, and\\nalso increases radar coverage. If flying near a town or\\ncity, it might be possible to read the name of the town\\non a water tower.\\nIf the airplane has a navigational radio, such as a VOR\\nor ADF receiver, it can be possible to determine\\nposition by plotting an azimuth from two or more\\nnavigational facilities. If GPS is installed, or a pilot has\\na portable aviation GPS on board, it can be used to\\ndetermine the position and the location of the\\nnearest airport.\\nCommunicate with any available facility using\\nfrequencies shown on the sectional chart. If contact is\\nmade with a controller, radar vectors may be offered.\\nOther facilities may offer direction finding (DF)\\nassistance. To use this procedure, the controller will\\nrequest the pilot to hold down the transmit button for a\\nfew seconds and then release it. The controller may ask\\nthe pilot to change directions a few times and repeat the\\ntransmit procedure. This gives the controller enough\\ninformation to plot the airplane position and then give\\nvectors to a suitable landing site. If the situation\\nbecomes threatening, transmit the situation on the\\nemergency frequency 121.5 MHz and set the\\ntransponder to 7700. Most facilities, and even airliners,\\nmonitor the emergency frequency.\\nFLIGHT DIVERSION\\nThere will probably come a time when a pilot will not\\nbe able to make it to the planned destination. This can\\nbe the result of unpredicted weather conditions, a\\nsystem malfunction, or poor preflight planning. In any\\ncase, the pilot will need to be able to safely and\\nefficiently divert to an alternate destination. Before any\\ncross-country flight, check the charts for airports or\\nsuitable landing areas along or near the route of flight.\\nAlso, check for navigational aids that can be used\\nduring a diversion.\\nComputing course, time, speed, and distance\\ninformation in flight requires the same computations\\nused during preflight planning. However, because of\\nthe limited cockpit space, and because attention must\\nbe divided between flying the airplane, making\\ncalculations, and scanning for other airplanes, take\\nadvantage of all possible shortcuts and rule-of-thumb\\ncomputations.\\nWhen in flight, it is rarely practical to actually plot a\\ncourse on a sectional chart and mark checkpoints and\\ndistances. Furthermore, because an alternate airport is\\nusually not very far from your original course, actual\\nplotting is seldom necessary.\\nA course to an alternate can be measured accurately\\nwith a protractor or plotter, but can also be measured\\nwith reasonable accuracy using a straightedge and the\\ncompass rose depicted around VOR stations. This\\napproximation can be made on the basis of a radial\\nfrom a nearby VOR or an airway that closely parallels\\nthe course to your alternate. However, remember that\\nthe magnetic heading associated with a VOR radial or\\nprinted airway is outbound from the station. To find the\\ncourse TO the station, it may be necessary to determine\\nthe reciprocal of that heading. It is typically easier to\\nnavigate to an alternate airport that has a VOR or NDB\\nfacility on the field.\\nCh 14.qxd  10/24/03  8:42 AM  Page 14-27'),\n",

If time\\npermits, try to start the diversion over a prominent\\nground feature. However, in an emergency, divert\\npromptly toward your alternate.

This chapter provides information on medical\\ncertification and on aeromedical factors related to\\nflying activities.\\nOBTAINING A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE\\nMost pilots must have a valid medical certificate to\\nexercise the privileges of their airman certificates.\\nGlider and free balloon pilots are not required to hold\\na medical certificate. Sport pilots may hold either a\\nmedical certificate or a valid state driver’s license.\\nTo acquire a medical certificate, an examination by an\\naviation medical examiner (AME), a physician with\\ntraining in aviation medicine designated by the Civil\\nAerospace Medical Institute (CAMI), is required. There\\nare three classes of medical certificates. The class of\\ncertificate needed depends on the type of flying the pilot\\nplans to do.\\nA third-class medical is required for a private or\\nrecreational pilot certificate. It is valid for 3 years for\\nthose individuals who have not reached the age of 40;\\notherwise it is valid for 2 years. A commercial pilot\\ncertificate requires at least a second-class medical\\ncertificate, which is valid for 1 year. First-class med-\\nical certificates are required for airline transport\\npilots, and are valid for 6 months.\\nThe standards are more rigorous for the higher\\nclasses of certificates. A pilot with a higher class\\nmedical certificate has met the requirements for the\\nlower classes as well. Since the class of medical\\nrequired applies only when exercising the privileges\\nof the pilot certificate for which it is required, a first-\\nclass medical would be valid for 1 year if exercising\\nthe privileges of a commercial certificate, and 2 or 3\\nyears, as appropriate, for exercising the privileges of\\na private or recreational certificate. The same applies\\nfor a second-class medical certificate. The standards\\nfor medical certification are contained in Title 14 of\\nthe Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 67,\\nand the requirements for obtaining medical certifi-\\ncates are in 14 CFR part 61.\\nStudents who have physical limitations, such as impaired\\nvision, loss of a limb, or hearing impairment may be issued\\na medical certificate valid for “student pilot privileges\\nonly” while they are learning to fly. Pilots with disabilities\\nmay require special equipment installed in the airplane,\\nsuch as hand controls for pilots with paraplegia. Some\\ndisabilities necessitate a limitation on the individual’s\\ncertificate; for example, impaired hearing would require\\nthe limitation “not valid for flight requiring the use of\\nradio.” When all the knowledge, experience, and profi-\\nciency requirements have been met and a student can\\ndemonstrate the ability to operate the airplane with the\\nnormal level of safety, a “statement of demonstrated\\nability” (SODA) can be issued. This waiver or SODA is\\nvalid as long as their physical impairment does not worsen.\\nContact the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)\\nfor more information on this subject.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='15-2\\nENVIRONMENTAL AND \\nHEALTH FACTORS\\nAFFECTING PILOT PERFORMANCE\\nA number of health factors and physiological effects can\\nbe linked to flying. Some are minor, while others are\\nimportant enough to require special attention to ensure\\nsafety of flight. In some cases, physiological factors can\\nlead to in-flight emergencies. Some important medical\\nfactors that a pilot should be aware of include hypoxia,\\nhyperventilation, middle ear and sinus problems, spatial\\ndisorientation, motion sickness, carbon monoxide poi-\\nsoning, stress and fatigue, dehydration, and heatstroke.\\nOther subjects include the effects of alcohol and drugs,\\nanxiety, and excess nitrogen in the blood after scuba\\ndiving.\\nHYPOXIA\\nHypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough\\noxygen.” Although any tissue will die if deprived of\\noxygen long enough, usually the most concern is with\\ngetting enough oxygen to the brain, since it is particu-\\nlarly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation. Any reduction\\nin mental function while flying can result in life-\\nthreatening errors. Hypoxia can be caused by several\\nfactors including an insufficient supply of oxygen,\\ninadequate transportation of oxygen, or the inability of\\nthe body tissues to use oxygen. The forms of hypoxia\\nare divided into four major groups based on their\\ncauses: hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, stagnant\\nhypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia.\\nHYPOXIC HYPOXIA\\nHypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen avail-\\nable to the lungs. A blocked airway or drowning are\\nobvious examples of how the lungs can be deprived of\\noxygen, but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen\\nat high altitude is an appropriate example for pilots.\\nAlthough the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is\\nconstant, its partial pressure decreases proportionately\\nas atmospheric pressure decreases. As the airplane\\nascends during flight, the percentage of each gas in the\\natmosphere remains the same, but there are fewer mole-\\ncules available at the pressure required for them to pass\\nbetween the membranes in the respiratory system. This\\ndecrease of oxygen molecules at sufficient pressure can\\nlead to hypoxic hypoxia.\\nHYPEMIC HYPOXIA\\nThis occurs when the blood is not able to take up and\\ntransport a sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells in\\nthe body. Hypemic means “not enough blood.” This\\ntype of hypoxia is a result of oxygen deficiency in the\\nblood, rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen, and can be\\ncaused by a variety of factors. It may be because there\\nis not enough blood volume (due to severe bleeding),\\nor may result from certain blood diseases, such as ane-\\nmia. More often it is because hemoglobin, the actual\\nblood molecule that transports oxygen, is chemically\\nunable to bind oxygen molecules. The most common\\nform of hypemic hypoxia is carbon monoxide poison-\\ning. Hypemic hypoxia also can be caused by the loss of\\nblood from a blood donation. Blood can take several\\nweeks to return to normal following a donation.\\nAlthough the effects of the blood loss are slight at\\nground level, there are risks when flying during this\\ntime.\\nSTAGNANT HYPOXIA\\nStagnant means “not flowing,” and stagnant hypoxia\\nresults when the oxygen-rich blood in the lungs isn’t\\nmoving, for one reason or another, to the tissues that\\nneed it. An arm or leg going to sleep because the\\nblood flow has accidentally been shut off is one form\\nof stagnant hypoxia. This kind of hypoxia can also\\nresult from shock, the heart failing to pump blood\\neffectively, or a constricted artery. During flight,\\nstagnant hypoxia can occur when pulling excessive\\npositive Gs. Cold temperatures also can reduce circu-\\nlation and decrease the blood supplied to extremities.\\nHISTOTOXIC HYPOXIA\\nThe inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen is\\ndefined as histotoxic hypoxia. “Histo” refers to tissues\\nor cells, and “toxic” means poison. In this case, plenty\\nof oxygen is being transported to the cells that need it,\\nbut they are unable to make use of it. This impairment\\nof cellular respiration can be caused by alcohol and\\nother drugs, such as narcotics and poisons. Research\\nhas shown that drinking one ounce of alcohol can\\nequate to about an additional 2,000 feet of physiologi-\\ncal altitude.\\nSYMPTOMS OF HYPOXIA\\nHigh-altitude flying can place a pilot in danger of\\nbecoming hypoxic. Oxygen starvation causes the\\nbrain and other vital organs to become impaired. One\\nparticularly noteworthy attribute of the onset of\\nhypoxia is the fact that the first symptoms are eupho-\\nria and a carefree feeling. With increased oxygen\\nstarvation, the extremities become less responsive\\nand flying becomes less coordinated. The symptoms\\nof hypoxia vary with the individual, but common\\nsymptoms include:\\n• Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips)\\n• Headache\\n• Decreased reaction time\\n• Impaired judgment\\n• Euphoria\\n• Visual impairment\\n• Drowsiness\\n• Lightheaded or dizzy sensation\\n• Tingling in fingers and toes\\n• Numbness\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='15-3\\nAs hypoxia worsens, the field of vision begins to\\nnarrow, and instrument interpretation can become\\ndifficult. Even with all these symptoms, the effects\\nof hypoxia can cause a pilot to have a false sense of\\nsecurity and be deceived into believing that every-\\nthing is normal. The treatment for hypoxia includes\\nflying at lower altitudes and/or using supplemental\\noxygen.\\nAll pilots are susceptible to the effects of oxygen\\nstarvation, regardless of physical endurance or\\nacclimatization. When flying at high altitudes, it is\\nparamount that oxygen be used to avoid the effects\\nof hypoxia. The term “time of useful consciousness”\\ndescribes the maximum time the pilot has to make\\nrational, life-saving decisions and carry them out at\\na given altitude without supplemental oxygen. As\\naltitude increases above 10,000 feet, the symptoms\\nof hypoxia increase in severity, and the time of use-\\nful consciousness rapidly decreases. [Figure 15-1]\\nSince symptoms of hypoxia can be different for each\\nindividual, the ability to recognize hypoxia can be\\ngreatly improved by experiencing and witnessing the\\neffects of it during an altitude chamber “flight.” The\\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides this\\nopportunity through aviation physiology training,\\nwhich is conducted at the FAA Civil Aerospace\\nMedical Institute (CAMI) and at many military facili-\\nties across the United States.

Box 25082\\nOklahoma City, OK 73125\\nHYPERVENTILATION\\nHyperventilation occurs when an individual is experi-\\nencing emotional stress, fright, or pain, and the\\nbreathing rate and depth increase, although the carbon\\ndioxide level in the blood is already at a reduced level.\\nThe result is an excessive loss of carbon dioxide from\\nthe body, which can lead to unconsciousness due to\\nthe respiratory system’s overriding mechanism to\\nregain control of breathing.\\nPilots encountering an unexpected stressful situation\\nmay unconsciously increase their breathing rate. If fly-\\ning at higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a\\npilot may have a tendency to breathe more rapidly than\\nnormal, which often leads to hyperventilation.\\nSince many of the symptoms of hyperventilation are\\nsimilar to those of hypoxia, it is important to correctly\\ndiagnose and treat the proper condition. If using sup-\\nplemental oxygen, check the equipment and flow rate\\nto ensure the symptoms are not hypoxia related.\\nCommon symptoms of hyperventilation include:\\n• Headache\\n• Decreased reaction time\\n• Impaired judgment\\n• Euphoria\\n• Visual impairment\\n• Drowsiness\\n• Lightheaded or dizzy sensation\\n• Tingling in fingers and toes\\n• Numbness\\n• Pale, clammy appearance\\n• Muscle spasms\\nHyperventilation may produce a pale, clammy\\nappearance and muscle spasms compared to the\\ncyanosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia.\\nThe treatment for hyperventilation involves restoring\\nthe proper carbon dioxide level in the body. Breathing\\nnormally is both the best prevention and the best cure\\nfor hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the\\nbreathing rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking\\naloud helps to overcome hyperventilation. Recovery\\nis usually rapid once the breathing rate is returned to\\nnormal.\\nMIDDLE EAR AND SINUS PROBLEMS\\nClimbs and descents can sometimes cause ear or sinus\\npain and a temporary reduction in the ability to hear.\\nThe physiological explanation for this discomfort is a\\ndifference between the pressure of the air outside the\\nAltitude Time of Useful\\nConsciousness\\n45,000 feet MSL\\n40,000 feet MSL\\n35,000 feet MSL\\n30,000 feet MSL\\n28,000 feet MSL\\n25,000 feet MSL\\n22,000 feet MSL\\n20,000 feet MSL\\n9 to 15 seconds\\n15 to 20 seconds\\n30 to 60 seconds\\n1 to 2 minutes\\n2 1/2 to 3 minutes\\n3 to 5 minutes\\n5 to 10 minutes\\n30 minutes or more\\nFigure 15-1.

It is closed off from the external ear canal by\\nthe eardrum. Normally, pressure differences between\\nthe middle ear and the outside world are equalized by a\\ntube leading from inside each ear to the back of the\\nthroat on each side, called the eustachian tube. These\\ntubes are usually closed, but open during chewing,\\nyawning, or swallowing to equalize pressure. Even a\\nslight difference between external pressure and middle\\near pressure can cause discomfort. [Figure 15-2]\\nDuring a climb, middle ear air pressure may exceed the\\npressure of the air in the external ear canal, causing the\\neardrum to bulge outward. Pilots become aware of this\\npressure change when they experience alternate sensa-\\ntions of “fullness” and “clearing.” During descent, the\\nreverse happens. While the pressure of the air in the\\nexternal ear canal increases, the middle ear cavity,\\nwhich equalized with the lower pressure at altitude, is\\nat lower pressure than the external ear canal. This\\nresults in the higher outside pressure, causing the\\neardrum to bulge inward.\\nThis condition can be more difficult to relieve due to\\nthe fact that the partial vacuum tends to constrict the\\nwalls of the eustachian tube. To remedy this often\\npainful condition, which also causes a temporary\\nreduction in hearing sensitivity, pinch the nostrils shut,\\nclose the mouth and lips, and blow slowly and gently in\\nthe mouth and nose.\\nThis procedure forces air through the eustachian tube\\ninto the middle ear. It may not be possible to equalize\\nthe pressure in the ears if a pilot has a cold, an ear infec-\\ntion, or sore throat. A flight in this condition can be\\nextremely painful, as well as damaging to the\\neardrums. If experiencing minor congestion, nose\\ndrops or nasal sprays may reduce the chance of a\\npainful ear blockage. Before using any medication,\\ncheck with an aviation medical examiner to ensure that\\nit will not affect the ability to fly.\\nIn a similar way, air pressure in the sinuses equalizes\\nwith the pressure in the cockpit through small openings\\nthat connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. An upper\\nrespiratory infection, such as a cold or sinusitis, or a\\nnasal allergic condition can produce enough congestion\\naround an opening to slow equalization. As the differ-\\nence in pressure between the sinus and the cockpit\\nincreases, congestion may plug the opening. This “sinus\\nblock” occurs most frequently during descent. Slow\\ndescent rates can reduce the associated pain. A sinus\\nblock can occur in the frontal sinuses, located above\\neach eyebrow, or in the maxillary sinuses, located in\\neach upper cheek. It will usually produce excruciating\\npain over the sinus area. A maxillary sinus block can\\nalso make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus may dis-\\ncharge from the nasal passages.\\nSinus block can be avoided by not flying with an upper\\nrespiratory infection or nasal allergic condition.\\nAdequate protection is usually not provided by decon-\\ngestant sprays or drops to reduce congestion around the\\nsinus openings. Oral decongestants have side effects\\nthat can impair pilot performance. If a sinus block does\\nnot clear shortly after landing, a physician should be\\nconsulted.\\nSPATIAL DISORIENTATION AND ILLUSIONS\\nSpatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of\\norientation with regard to the position, attitude, or\\nmovement of the airplane in space. The body uses\\nthree integrated systems working together to ascertain\\norientation and movement in space. The eye is by far\\nthe largest source of information. Kinesthesia refers to\\nthe sensation of position, movement, and tension per-\\nceived through the nerves, muscles, and tendons. The\\nvestibular system is a very sensitive motion sensing\\nsystem located in the inner ears. It reports head posi-\\ntion, orientation, and movement in three-dimensional\\nspace.\\nAll this information comes together in the brain, and\\nmost of the time, the three streams of information agree,\\ngiving a clear idea of where and how the body is mov-\\ning. Flying can sometimes cause these systems to supply\\nconflicting information to the brain, which can lead to\\ndisorientation. During flight in visual meteorological\\nconditions (VMC), the eyes are the major orientation\\nsource and usually prevail over false sensations from\\nother sensory systems. When these visual cues are taken\\naway, as they are in instrument meteorological condi-\\ntions (IMC), false sensations can cause a pilot to quickly\\nbecome disoriented.\\nThe vestibular system in the inner ear allows the\\npilot to sense movement and determine orientation\\nMIDDLE EAR\\nOpening\\nto ThroatEustachian\\nTube\\nAuditory\\nCanal\\nOUTER EAR\\nEardrum\\nFigure 15-2.The eustachian tube allows air pressure to equal-\\nize in the middle ear.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-4'),\n",

In both the left and\\nright inner ear, three semicircular canals are posi-\\ntioned at approximate right angles to each other.\\nEach canal is filled with fluid and has a section full\\nof fine hairs. Acceleration of the inner ear in any\\ndirection causes the tiny hairs to deflect, which in\\nturn stimulates nerve impulses, sending messages to\\nthe brain. The vestibular nerve transmits the\\nimpulses from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular\\ncanals to the brain to interpret motion. [Figure 15-3]\\nThe postural system sends signals from the skin,\\njoints, and muscles to the brain that are interpreted in\\nrelation to the earth’s gravitational pull. These signals\\ndetermine posture. Inputs from each movement\\nupdate the body’s position to the brain on a constant\\nbasis. “Seat of the pants” flying is largely dependent\\nupon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual\\nand vestibular clues, these sensations can be fairly\\nreliable. However, the body cannot distinguish\\nbetween acceleration forces due to gravity and those\\nresulting from maneuvering the aircraft, which can\\nlead to sensory illusions and false impressions of the\\nairplane’s orientation and movement.\\nUnder normal flight conditions, when there is a\\nvisual reference to the horizon and ground, the sen-\\nsory system in the inner ear helps to identify the\\npitch, roll, and yaw movements of the airplane. When\\nvisual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular\\nsystem becomes unreliable. Without visual refer-\\nences outside the airplane, there are many situations\\nwhere combinations of normal motions and forces\\ncan create convincing illusions that are difficult to\\novercome. In a classic example, a pilot may believe\\nthe airplane is in level flight, when, in reality, it is in\\na gradual turn. If the airspeed increases, the pilot may\\nexperience a postural sensation of a level dive and\\npull back on the stick, which tightens the turn and\\ncreates increasing G-loads. If recovery is not initi-\\nated, a steep spiral will develop. This is sometimes\\ncalled the graveyard spiral, because if the pilot fails\\nto recognize that the airplane is in a spiral and fails to\\nreturn the airplane to wings-level flight, the airplane\\nwill eventually strike the ground. If the horizon\\nbecomes visible again, the pilot will have an oppor-\\ntunity to return the airplane to straight-and-level\\nflight, and continued visual contact with the horizon\\nwill allow the pilot to maintain straight-and-level\\nflight. However, if contact with the horizon is lost\\nagain, the inner ear may fool the pilot into thinking\\nthe airplane has started a bank in the other direction,\\ncausing the graveyard spiral to begin all over again.\\nPrevention is usually the best remedy for spatial disori-\\nentation. Unless a pilot has many hours of training in\\ninstrument flight, flight in reduced visibility or at night\\nwhen the horizon is not visible should be avoided. A\\npilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions\\nthrough training and awareness, and learning to rely\\ntotally on flight instruments.\\nBesides the sensory illusions due to misleading inputs\\nto the vestibular system, a pilot may also encounter var-\\nious visual illusions during flight. Illusions rank among\\nthe most common factors cited as contributing to fatal\\nairplane accidents.\\nSloping cloud formations, an obscured horizon, a dark\\nscene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain\\ngeometric patterns of ground light can create illusions\\nof not being aligned correctly with the actual horizon.\\nVarious surface features and atmospheric conditions\\nencountered in landing can create illusions of being\\non the wrong approach path.

[Figure 15-4]\\nA runway that slopes up, or upsloping terrain, can cre-\\nate the illusion that the airplane is at a higher altitude\\nthan it actually is, and downsloping runways or terrain\\ncan create the opposite effect. Rain on the windshield\\ncan create the illusion of greater height, and haze can\\nmake distances appear greater than they are.\\nAt sunrise or sunset, a pilot may encounter flicker\\nvertigo. In some individuals, flashing lights at certain\\nfrequencies can trigger seizures, nausea, convulsions,\\nor unconsciousness. Seeing the sun through a slow-\\nmoving propeller can produce the effect of a flashing\\nlight. So can bright light reflecting off the back of the\\npropeller. Symptoms are rare, but be aware of the\\npossibility.\\nMOTION SICKNESS\\nMotion sickness, or airsickness, is caused by the brain\\nreceiving conflicting messages about the state of the\\nbody. A pilot may experience motion sickness during\\ninitial flights, but it generally goes away within the\\nfirst few lessons. Anxiety and stress, which may be\\nexperienced at the beginning of flight training, can\\ncontribute to motion sickness. Symptoms of motion\\nsickness include general discomfort, nausea, dizzi-\\nness, paleness, sweating, and vomiting.\\nIt is important to remember that experiencing airsick-\\nness is no reflection on one’s ability as a pilot. If\\nprone to motion sickness, let the flight instructor\\nknow since there are techniques that can be used to\\novercome this problem. For example, avoid lessons in\\nturbulent conditions until becoming more comfortable\\nin the airplane, or start with shorter flights and gradu-\\nate to longer instruction periods. If symptoms of\\nmotion sickness are experienced during a lesson,\\nopening fresh air vents, focusing on objects outside\\nthe airplane, and avoiding unnecessary head move-\\nments may help alleviate some of the discomfort.\\nAlthough medications like Dramamine can prevent\\nairsickness in passengers, they are not recommended\\nwhile flying since they can cause drowsiness and\\nother problems.\\nCARBON MONOXIDE POISONING\\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas\\nproduced by all internal combustion engines. Since it\\nattaches itself to the hemoglobin in the blood about 200\\ntimes more easily than oxygen, carbon monoxide pre-\\nvents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells,\\nresulting in hypemic hypoxia. It can take up to 48 hours\\nfor the body to dispose of carbon monoxide. If the poi-\\nsoning is severe enough, it can result in death. Aircraft\\nheater vents and defrost vents may provide carbon\\nmonoxide a passageway into the cabin, particularly if\\nthe engine exhaust system has a leak or is damaged. If a\\nstrong odor of exhaust gases is detected, assume that car-\\nbon monoxide is present. However, carbon monoxide\\nmay be present in dangerous amounts even if no exhaust\\nodor is detected. Disposable, inexpensive carbon\\nmonoxide detectors are widely available. In the presence\\nof carbon monoxide, these detectors change color to alert\\nthe pilot of the presence of carbon monoxide. Some\\neffects of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache,\\nblurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, and/or loss of\\nmuscle power. Anytime a pilot smells exhaust odor, or\\nany time that these symptoms are experienced, immedi-\\nate corrective actions should be taken. These include\\nturning off the heater, opening fresh air vents and win-\\ndows, and using supplemental oxygen, if available.\\nTobacco smoke also causes carbon monoxide poisoning.\\nSmoking at sea level can raise the CO concentration in\\nthe blood and result in physiological effects similar to\\nflying at 8,000 feet. Besides hypoxia, tobacco causes dis-\\neases and physiological debilitation that are medically\\ndisqualifying for pilots.\\nSTRESS\\nStress is defined as the body’s response to physical and\\npsychological demands placed upon it. The body’s\\nreaction to stress includes releasing chemical hormones\\n(such as adrenaline) into the blood, and increasing\\nmetabolism to provide more energy to the muscles. The\\nblood sugar, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and\\nperspiration all increase. The term “stressor” is used to\\ndescribe an element that causes an individual to experi-\\nence stress. Examples of stressors include physical\\nstress (noise or vibration), physiological stress\\n(fatigue), and psychological stress (difficult work or\\npersonal situations).\\nStress falls into two broad categories, including acute\\nstress (short term) and chronic stress (long term). Acute\\nNarrow Normal Wide\\nFigure 15-4. Runway Illusions.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='15-7\\nstress involves an immediate threat that is perceived as\\ndanger. This is the type of stress that triggers a “fight or\\nflight” response in an individual, whether the threat is\\nreal or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can cope\\nwith acute stress and prevent stress overload. However,\\non-going acute stress can develop into chronic stress.\\nChronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that\\npresents an intolerable burden, exceeds the ability of an\\nindividual to cope, and causes individual performance\\nto fall sharply. Unrelenting psychological pressures,\\nsuch as loneliness, financial worries, and relationship\\nor work problems can produce a cumulative level of\\nstress that exceeds a person’s ability to cope with the\\nsituation. When stress reaches these levels, perform-\\nance falls off rapidly. Pilots experiencing this level of\\nstress are not safe and should not exercise their airman\\nprivileges. Pilots who suspect they are suffering from\\nchronic stress should consult a physician.\\nFATIGUE\\nFatigue is frequently associated with pilot error.\\nSome of the effects of fatigue include degradation of\\nattention and concentration, impaired coordination,\\nand decreased ability to communicate. These factors\\ncan seriously influence the ability to make effective\\ndecisions. Physical fatigue can result from sleep loss,\\nexercise, or physical work. Factors such as stress and\\nprolonged performance of cognitive work can result\\nin mental fatigue.\\nLike stress, fatigue also falls into two broad categories:\\nacute and chronic. Acute fatigue is short term and is a\\nnormal occurrence in everyday living. It is the kind of\\ntiredness people feel after a period of strenuous effort,\\nexcitement, or lack of sleep. Rest after exertion and 8\\nhours of sound sleep ordinarily cures this condition.\\nA special type of acute fatigue is skill fatigue. This type\\nof fatigue has two main effects on performance:\\n• Timing disruption \\uf8e7Appearing to perform a\\ntask as usual, but the timing of each component is\\nslightly off. This makes the pattern of the opera-\\ntion less smooth, because the pilot performs each\\ncomponent as though it were separate, instead of\\npart of an integrated activity.\\n• Disruption of the perceptual field \\uf8e7\\nConcentrating attention upon movements or\\nobjects in the center of vision and neglecting\\nthose in the periphery. This may be accompanied\\nby loss of accuracy and smoothness in control\\nmovements.\\nAcute fatigue has many causes, but the following are\\namong the most important for the pilot:\\n• Mild hypoxia (oxygen deficiency)\\n• Physical stress\\n• Psychological stress\\n• Depletion of physical energy resulting from psy-\\nchological stress\\nSustained psychological stress accelerates the glandular\\nsecretions that prepare the body for quick reactions dur-\\ning an emergency. These secretions make the circulatory\\nand respiratory systems work harder, and the liver\\nreleases energy to provide the extra fuel needed for brain\\nand muscle work. When this reserve energy supply is\\ndepleted, the body lapses into generalized and severe\\nfatigue.\\nAcute fatigue can be prevented by a proper diet and\\nadequate rest and sleep. A well-balanced diet prevents\\nthe body from having to consume its own tissues as an\\nenergy source. Adequate rest maintains the body’s store\\nof vital energy.\\nChronic fatigue, extending over a long period of time,\\nusually has psychological roots, although an underlying\\ndisease is sometimes responsible. Continuous high stress\\nlevels, for example, can produce chronic fatigue. Chronic\\nfatigue is not relieved by proper diet and adequate rest\\nand sleep, and usually requires treatment by a physician.\\nAn individual may experience this condition in the form\\nof weakness, tiredness, palpitations of the heart, breath-\\nlessness, headaches, or irritability. Sometimes chronic\\nfatigue even creates stomach or intestinal problems and\\ngeneralized aches and pains throughout the body. When\\nthe condition becomes serious enough, it can lead to\\nemotional illness.\\nIf suffering from acute fatigue, stay on the ground. If\\nfatigue occurs in the cockpit, no amount of training or\\nexperience can overcome the detrimental effects.\\nGetting adequate rest is the only way to prevent\\nfatigue from occurring. Avoid flying without a full\\nnight’s rest, after working excessive hours, or after an\\nespecially exhausting or stressful day. Pilots who sus-\\npect they are suffering from chronic fatigue should\\nconsult a physician.\\nDEHYDRATION AND HEATSTROKE\\nDehydration is the term given to a critical loss of\\nwater from the body. The first noticeable effect of\\ndehydration is fatigue, which in turn makes top\\nphysical and mental performance difficult, if not\\nimpossible. As a pilot, flying for long periods in hot\\nsummer temperatures or at high altitudes increases\\nthe susceptibility of dehydration since the dry air at\\naltitude tends to increase the rate of water loss from\\nthe body. If this fluid is not replaced, fatigue pro-\\ngresses to dizziness, weakness, nausea, tingling of\\nhands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extreme\\nthirst.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-7'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='15-8\\nHeatstroke is a condition caused by any inability of the\\nbody to control its temperature. Onset of this condition\\nmay be recognized by the symptoms of dehydration,\\nbut also has been known to be recognized only by\\ncomplete collapse.\\nTo prevent these symptoms, it is recommended that an\\nample supply of water be carried and used at frequent\\nintervals on any long flight, whether thirsty or not. If\\nthe airplane has a canopy or roof window, wearing\\nlight-colored, porous clothing and a hat will help pro-\\nvide protection from the sun. Keeping the cockpit well\\nventilated aids in dissipating excess heat.\\nALCOHOL\\nAlcohol impairs the efficiency of the human mecha-\\nnism. Studies have positively proven that drinking\\nand performance deterioration are closely linked.\\nPilots must make hundreds of decisions, some of them\\ntime-critical, during the course of a flight. The safe\\noutcome of any flight depends on the ability to make\\nthe correct decisions and take the appropriate actions\\nduring routine occurrences, as well as abnormal situa-\\ntions. The influence of alcohol drastically reduces the\\nchances of completing a flight without incident. Even\\nin small amounts, alcohol can impair judgment,\\ndecrease sense of responsibility, affect coordination,\\nconstrict visual field, diminish memory, reduce rea-\\nsoning power, and lower attention span. As little as\\none ounce of alcohol can decrease the speed and\\nstrength of muscular reflexes, lessen the efficiency of\\neye movements while reading, and increase the fre-\\nquency at which errors are committed. Impairments\\nin vision and hearing occur at alcohol blood levels as\\nlow as .01 percent.\\nThe alcohol consumed in beer and mixed drinks is\\nethyl alcohol, a central nervous system depressant.\\nFrom a medical point of view, it acts on the body much\\nlike a general anesthetic. The “dose” is generally much\\nlower and more slowly consumed in the case of alco-\\nhol, but the basic effects on the system are similar.\\nAlcohol is easily and quickly absorbed by the digestive\\ntract. The bloodstream absorbs about 80 to 90 percent\\nof the alcohol in a drink within 30 minutes on an empty\\nstomach. The body requires about 3 hours to rid itself\\nof all the alcohol contained in one mixed drink or one\\nbeer.\\nWith a hangover, a pilot is still under the influence of\\nalcohol. Although a pilot may think that he or she is\\nfunctioning normally, the impairment of motor and\\nmental responses still remains. Considerable amounts\\nof alcohol can remain in the body for over 16 hours, so\\npilots should be cautious about flying too soon after\\ndrinking.\\nAltitude multiplies the effects of alcohol on the brain.\\nWhen combined with altitude, the alcohol from two\\ndrinks may have the same effect as three or four drinks.\\nAlcohol interferes with the brain’s ability to utilize\\noxygen, producing a form of histotoxic hypoxia. The\\neffects are rapid because alcohol passes so quickly into\\nthe bloodstream. In addition, the brain is a highly vas-\\ncular organ that is immediately sensitive to changes in\\nthe blood’s composition. For a pilot, the lower oxygen\\navailability at altitude, along with the lower capability\\nof the brain to use what oxygen is there, adds up to a\\ndeadly combination.\\nIntoxication is determined by the amount of alcohol in\\nthe bloodstream. This is usually measured as a percent-\\nage by weight in the blood. 14 CFR part 91 requires\\nthat blood alcohol level be less than .04 percent and\\nthat 8 hours pass between drinking alcohol and piloting\\nan airplane. A pilot with a blood alcohol level of .04\\npercent or greater after 8 hours cannot fly until the\\nblood alcohol falls below that amount. Even though\\nblood alcohol may be well below .04 percent, a pilot\\ncannot fly sooner than 8 hours after drinking alcohol.\\nAlthough the regulations are quite specific, it is a good\\nidea to be more conservative than the regulations.\\nDRUGS\\nPilot performance can be seriously degraded by both\\nprescribed and over-the-counter medications, as well\\nas by the medical conditions for which they are taken.\\nMany medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives,\\nstrong pain relievers, and cough-suppressants have\\nprimary effects that may impair judgment, memory,\\nalertness, coordination, vision, and the ability to make\\ncalculations. Others, such as antihistamines, blood\\npressure drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to con-\\ntrol diarrhea and motion sickness have side effects\\nthat may impair the same critical functions. Any med-\\nication that depresses the nervous system, such as a\\nsedative, tranquilizer, or antihistamine can make a\\npilot more susceptible to hypoxia.\\nPain-killers can be grouped into two broad categories:\\nanalgesics and anesthetics. Analgesics are drugs that\\nreduce pain, while anesthetics are drugs that deaden\\npain or cause loss of consciousness.\\nOver-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic\\nacid (Aspirin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ibupro-\\nfen (Advil) have few side effects when taken in the\\ncorrect dosage. Although some people are allergic to\\ncertain analgesics or may suffer from stomach irrita-\\ntion, flying usually is not restricted when taking these\\ndrugs. However, flying is almost always precluded\\nwhile using prescription analgesics, such as Darvon,\\nPercodan, Demerol, and codeine since these drugs\\nmay cause side effects such as mental confusion,\\ndizziness, headaches, nausea, and vision problems.\\nCh 15.qxd  10/24/03  8:46 AM  Page 15-8'),\n",

Most local anesthetics used for\\nminor dental and outpatient procedures wear off within\\na relatively short period of time. The anesthetic itself\\nmay not limit flying so much as the actual procedure\\nand subsequent pain.\\nStimulants are drugs that excite the central nervous\\nsystem and produce an increase in alertness and activ-\\nity. Amphetamines, caffeine, and nicotine are all\\nforms of stimulants. Common uses of these drugs\\ninclude appetite suppression, fatigue reduction, and\\nmood elevation. Some of these drugs may cause a\\nstimulant reaction, even though this reaction is not\\ntheir primary function. In some cases, stimulants can\\nproduce anxiety and mood swings, both of which are\\ndangerous when flying.\\nDepressants are drugs that reduce the body’s functioning\\nin many areas. These drugs lower blood pressure, reduce\\nmental processing, and slow motor and reaction\\nresponses. There are several types of drugs that can cause\\na depressing effect on the body, including tranquilizers,\\nmotion sickness medication, some types of stomach med-\\nication, decongestants, and antihistamines. The most\\ncommon depressant is alcohol.\\nSome drugs, which can neither be classified as stimu-\\nlants nor depressants, have adverse effects on flying.\\nFor example, some forms of antibiotics can produce\\ndangerous side effects, such as balance disorders,\\nhearing loss, nausea, and vomiting. While many\\nantibiotics are safe for use while flying, the infection\\nrequiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying. In addi-\\ntion, unless specifically prescribed by a physician, do\\nnot take more than one drug at a time, and never mix\\ndrugs with alcohol, because the effects are often\\nunpredictable.\\nThe dangers of illegal drugs also are well documented.\\nCertain illegal drugs can have hallucinatory effects that\\noccur days or weeks after the drug is taken. Obviously,\\nthese drugs have no place in the aviation community.\\nThe Code of Federal Regulations prohibits pilots from\\nperforming crewmember duties while using any med-\\nication that affects the faculties in any way contrary to\\nsafety. The safest rule is not to fly as a crewmember\\nwhile taking any medication, unless approved to do so\\nby the FAA. If there is any doubt regarding the effects\\nof any medication, consult an aviation medical exam-\\niner before flying.\\nSCUBA DIVING\\nScuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure,\\nwhich allows more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues\\nand fluids. The reduction of atmospheric pressure that\\naccompanies flying can produce physical problems for\\nscuba divers. Reducing the pressure too quickly allows\\nsmall bubbles of nitrogen to form inside the body as\\nthe gas comes out of solution. These bubbles can cause\\na painful and potentially incapacitating condition\\ncalled “the bends.” (An example is dissolved gas form-\\ning bubbles as pressure decreases by slowly opening a\\ntransparent bottle of soda.) Scuba training emphasizes\\nhow to prevent the bends when rising to the surface,\\nbut increased nitrogen concentrations can remain in tis-\\nsue fluids for several hours after a diver leaves the\\nwater. The bends can be experienced from as low as\\n8,000 feet MSL, with increasing severity as altitude\\nincreases. As noted in the Aeronautical Information\\nManual (AIM), the minimum recommended time\\nbetween scuba diving on nondecompression stop dives\\nand flying is 12 hours, while the minimum time recom-\\nmended between decompression stop diving and flying\\nis 24 hours. [Figure 15-5]\\nVISION IN FLIGHT\\nOf all the senses, vision is the most important for safe\\nflight. Most of the things perceived while flying are\\nvisual or heavily supplemented by vision. As remarkable\\nand vital as it is, vision is subject to some limitations,\\nsuch as illusions and blind spots. The more a pilot under-\\nstands about the eyes and how they function, the easier it\\nis to use vision effectively and compensate for potential\\nproblems.\\nThe eye functions much like a camera. Its structure\\nincludes an aperture, a lens, a mechanism for focusing,\\nand a surface for registering images. Light enters\\nFigure 15-5.

The retina con-\\ntains light sensitive cells that convert light energy into\\nelectrical impulses that travel through nerves to the\\nbrain. The brain interprets the electrical signals to form\\nimages. There are two kinds of light sensitive cells in\\nthe eyes: rods and cones. [Figure 15-6]\\nThe cones are responsible for all color vision, from\\nappreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle\\nshades in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout\\nthe retina, but are concentrated toward the center of the\\nfield of vision at the back of the retina. There is a small\\npit called the fovea where almost all the light sensing\\ncells are cones. This is the area where most “looking”\\noccurs (the center of the visual field where detail, color\\nsensitivity, and resolution are highest).\\nWhile the cones and their associated nerves are well\\nsuited to detecting fine detail and color in high light\\nlevels, the rods are better able to detect movement and\\nprovide vision in dim light. The rods are unable to dis-\\ncern color but are very sensitive in low light levels.\\nThe trouble with rods is that a large amount of light\\noverwhelms them, and they take a long time to “reset”\\nand adapt to the dark again. There are so many cones\\nin the fovea that the very center of the visual field\\nhardly has any rods at all. So in low light, the middle\\nof the visual field isn’t very sensitive, but farther from\\nthe fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide\\nthe major portion of night vision. \\nThe area where the optic nerve enters the eyeball has\\nno rods or cones, leaving a blind spot in the field of\\nvision. Normally, each eye compensates for the other’s\\nblind spot. Figure 15-7 provides a dramatic example of\\nthe eye’s blind spot. Cover the right eye and hold this\\npage at arm’s length. Focus the left eye on the X in the\\nright side of the windshield and notice what happens to\\nthe airplane while slowly bringing the page closer to\\nthe eye.\\nEMPTY-FIELD MYOPIA\\nAnother problem associated with flying at night, in\\ninstrument meteorological conditions and/or reduced\\nvisibility is empty-field myopia, or induced nearsighted-\\nness. With nothing to focus on, the eyes automatically\\nfocus on a point just slightly ahead of the airplane.\\nSearching out and focusing on distant light sources, no\\nmatter how dim, helps prevent the onset of empty-field\\nmyopia.\\nNIGHT VISION\\nIt is estimated that once fully adapted to darkness, the\\nrods are 10,000 times more sensitive to light than the\\ncones, making them the primary receptors for night\\nvision. Since the cones are concentrated near the fovea,\\nthe rods are also responsible for much of the peripheral\\nvision. The concentration of cones in the fovea can make\\na night blind spot in the center of the field of vision. To\\nsee an object clearly at night, the pilot must expose the\\nrods to the image. This can be done by looking 5°to 10°\\noff center of the object to be seen. This can be tried in a\\nThe rods and cones (film) of the retina are\\nthe receptors which record the image and \\ntransmit it through the optic nerve to the \\nbrain for interpretation. \\nLight passes through the \\ncornea (the transparent window \\non the front of the eye) and \\nthen through the lens to focus\\non the retina.\\nThe pupil (aperture) is the \\nopening at the center of the\\niris.

When looking\\nslightly off center, it becomes clearer and brighter. \\nRefer to figure 15-8. When looking directly at an\\nobject, the image is focused mainly on the fovea, where\\ndetail is best seen. At night, the ability to see an object\\nin the center of the visual field is reduced as the cones\\nlose much of their visual acuity and the rods become\\nmore sensitive. Looking off center can help compen-\\nsate for this night blind spot. Along with the loss of\\nsharpness and color at night, depth perception and\\njudgment of size may be lost.\\nWhile the cones adapt rapidly to changes in light inten-\\nsities, the rods take much longer. Walking from bright\\nsunlight into a dark movie theater is an example of this\\ndark adaptation period experience. The rods can take\\napproximately 30 minutes to fully adapt to the dark. A\\nbright light, however, can completely destroy night\\nadaptation, leaving night vision severely compromised\\nwhile the adaptation process is repeated.\\nSeveral things can be done to keep the eyes adapted to\\nthe dark. The first is obvious: avoid bright lights before\\nand during the flight. For 30 minutes before a night\\nflight, avoid any bright light sources, such as head-\\nlights, landing lights, strobe lights, or flashlights. If a\\nbright light is encountered, close one eye to keep it\\nlight sensitive. This allows the use of that eye to see\\nagain once the light is gone.\\nRed cockpit lighting also helps preserve night vision, but\\nred light severely distorts some colors and completely\\nwashes out the color red. This makes reading an aero-\\nnautical chart difficult. A dim white light or a carefully\\ndirected flashlight can enhance night reading ability.\\nWhile flying at night, keep the instrument panel and inte-\\nrior lights turned up no higher than necessary. This helps\\nto see outside references more easily. If the eyes become\\nblurry, blinking more frequently often helps.\\nDiet and general physical health have an impact on\\nhow well a pilot can see in the dark. Deficiencies in\\nvitamins A and C have been shown to reduce night acu-\\nity. Other factors, such as carbon monoxide poisoning,\\nsmoking, alcohol, certain drugs, and a lack of oxygen\\nalso can greatly decrease night vision.\\nNIGHT VISUAL ILLUSIONS\\nThere are many different types of visual illusions that\\ncommonly occur at night. Anticipating and staying\\naware of them is usually the best way to avoid them.\\nAUTOKINESIS\\nAutokinesis is caused by staring at a single point of light\\nagainst a dark background for more than a few seconds.\\nAfter a few moments, the light appears to move on its\\nown. To prevent this illusion, focus the eyes on objects at\\nvarying distances and avoid fixating on one target. Be\\nsure to maintain a normal scan pattern.\\nFALSE HORIZON\\nA false horizon can occur when the natural horizon is\\nobscured or not readily apparent. It can be generated by\\nconfusing bright stars and city lights. It can also occur\\nwhile flying toward the shore of an ocean or a large\\nlake. Because of the relative darkness of the water, the\\nlights along the shoreline can be mistaken for stars in\\nthe sky. [Figure 15-9]\\nCones Active\\nRods Active Night Blind Spot\\nFigure 15-8.

The impor-\\ntance of learning effective ADM skills cannot be\\noveremphasized. While progress is continually being\\nmade in the advancement of pilot training methods, air-\\nplane equipment and systems, and services for pilots,\\naccidents still occur. Despite all the changes in technol-\\nogy to improve flight safety, one factor remains the\\nsame\\uf8e7the human factor. It is estimated that approxi-\\nmately 75 percent of all aviation accidents are human\\nfactors related.\\nHistorically, the term “pilot error” has been used to\\ndescribe the causes of these accidents. Pilot error\\nmeans that an action or decision made by the pilot was\\nthe cause, or a contributing factor that led to the acci-\\ndent. This definition also includes the pilot’s failure to\\nmake a decision or take action. From a broader per-\\nspective, the phrase “human factors related” more aptly\\ndescribes these accidents since it is usually not a single\\ndecision that leads to an accident, but a chain of events\\ntriggered by a number of factors.\\nThe poor judgment chain, sometimes referred to as the\\n“error chain,” is a term used to describe this concept of\\ncontributing factors in a human factors-related acci-\\ndent. Breaking one link in the chain normally is all that\\nis necessary to change the outcome of the sequence of\\nevents. The following is an example illustrating the\\npoor judgment chain.\\nA private pilot with around 350 hours was ferrying an\\nairplane cross-country to a new owner. Due to time\\nconstraints, the pilot skipped dinner the night before\\nand had no breakfast on the morning of the flight. The\\npilot planned to have lunch around noon at a fuel stop.\\nA descent was begun from 9,500 feet, about 20 miles\\nfrom the chosen fuel stop, due to haze and unfamiliarity\\nwith the area. When the airplane arrived at pattern alti-\\ntude, the pilot could not find the airport. The pilot then\\ncircled north of the town, then back over the town, then\\nflew to the west, then turned back to the east.\\nThe pilot decided to check for airport information in\\nthe Airport/Facility Directory, which was on the rear\\nseat and not readily available.\\nPower had not been increased since the descent to\\npattern altitude, and the pilot had been holding back\\npressure on the yoke. While attempting to retrieve the\\nAirport/Facility Directory, a loud “bang” was heard.\\nLooking up, the pilot discovered the airplane was only\\nabout 200 feet above ground level.

For\\nexample, one of the first elements that affected the\\npilot’s flight was fatigue. The pilot understood that\\nfatigue and hunger could affect the ability to fly\\nsafely, but let the desire to stay on schedule override\\nthe concern for a safe flight.\\nNext, the rush to get airborne led the pilot to skip or\\npostpone necessary aspects of preflight planning.\\nResearch before takeoff, with a quick review before\\ndescent, could have ensured a clear mental picture of\\nthe location of the airport in relation to the town.\\nCopying relevant information from flight guides and\\nother information sources is part of careful preflight\\nplanning. Studying the aeronautical charts and check-\\ning the Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) beforehand\\nwould have alerted the pilot to towers, terrain, and\\nother obstructions in the vicinity of the airport.\\nEven without proper planning before the flight, good\\ncockpit resource management and organization would\\nhave had the flight guide and any other necessary infor-\\nmation near at hand, perhaps with the relevant pages\\nflagged. Approaching the airport environment and fly-\\ning around the area at traffic pattern altitude in hazy\\nconditions could have interfered with other air traffic,\\nand the potential for a midair collision is obvious.\\nIn all circumstances, the pilot’s first duty is to fly the\\nairplane. Clearly that would include adjusting the\\npower, setting the trim, and keeping track of altitude.\\nThis pilot was extremely fortunate—the outcome could\\neasily have been fatal.\\nOn numerous occasions during the flight, the pilot could\\nhave made effective decisions that would have broken\\nthe chain of error and prevented this accident. Making\\nsound decisions is the key to preventing accidents.\\nTraditional pilot training has emphasized flying skills,\\nknowledge of the airplane, and familiarity with regula-\\ntions. ADM training focuses on the decision-making\\nprocess and the factors that affect a pilot’s ability to\\nmake effective choices.\\nORIGINS OF ADM TRAINING\\nThe airlines developed some of the first training\\nprograms that focused on improving aeronautical\\ndecision making. Human factors-related accidents\\nmotivated the airline industry to implement crew\\nresource management (CRM) training for flight\\ncrews. The focus of CRM programs is the effective\\nuse of all available resources; human resources,\\nhardware, and information. Human resources\\ninclude all groups routinely working with the cock-\\npit crew (or pilot) who are involved in decisions\\nthat are required to operate a flight safely. These\\ngroups include, but are not limited to: dispatchers,\\ncabin crewmembers, maintenance personnel, and\\nair traffic controllers. Although the CRM concept\\noriginated as airlines developed ways of facilitating\\ncrew cooperation to improve decision making in the\\ncockpit, CRM principles, such as workload manage-\\nment, situational awareness, communication, the\\nleadership role of the captain, and crewmember\\ncoordination have direct application to the general\\naviation cockpit. This also includes single pilot\\noperations since pilots of small airplanes, as well as\\ncrews of larger airplanes, must make effective use\\nof all available resources—human resources, hard-\\nware, and information. AC 60-22, Aeronautical\\nDecision Making , provides background references,\\ndefinitions, and other pertinent information about\\nADM training in the general aviation environment.\\n[Figure 16-1]\\nTHE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS\\nAn understanding of the decision-making process\\nprovides a pilot with a foundation for developing\\nADM skills. Some situations, such as engine fail-\\nures, require a pilot to respond immediately using\\nestablished procedures with little time for detailed\\nanalysis. Traditionally, pilots have been well trained\\nto react to emergencies, but are not as well prepared\\nto make decisions requiring a more reflective\\nresponse. Typically during a flight, there is time to\\nexamine any changes that occur, gather information,\\nand assess risk before reaching a decision. The steps\\nleading to this conclusion constitute the decision-\\nmaking process. \\nDEFINING THE PROBLEM\\nProblem definition is the first step in the decision-\\nmaking process. Defining the problem begins with\\nrecognizing that a change has occurred or that an\\nexpected change did not occur. A problem is perceived\\nfirst by the senses, then is distinguished through\\ninsight and experience. These same abilities, as well as\\nan objective analysis of all available information, are\\nused to determine the exact nature and severity of the\\nproblem.\\nOne critical error that can be made during the deci-\\nsion-making process is incorrectly defining the\\nproblem. For example, a low oil pressure reading\\ncould indicate that the engine is about to fail and an\\nemergency landing should be planned, or it could\\nmean that the oil pressure sensor has failed. The\\nactions to be taken in each of these circumstances\\nwould be significantly different. Fixating on a\\nproblem that does not exist can divert attention\\nfrom important tasks. The pilot’s failure to main-\\ntain an awareness of the circumstances regarding\\nthe flight now becomes the problem. This is why\\nonce an initial assumption is made regarding the\\nproblem, other sources must be used to verify that\\nthe conclusion is correct.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='16-3\\nWhile on a cross-country flight, a pilot discovered that\\nfuel consumption was significantly higher than predicted\\nduring flight planning. By noticing this discrepancy,\\nchange has been recognized. Based on insight, cross-\\ncountry flying experience, and knowledge of airplane\\nsystems, the pilot considers the possibility that there\\nmight be enough fuel to reach the destination. Factors\\nthat may increase the fuel burn rate could include\\nenvironmental factors, such as higher-than-expected\\nheadwinds and lower-than-expected groundspeed. To\\ndetermine the severity of the problem, recalculate the\\nfuel consumption and reassess fuel requirements .\\nCHOOSING A COURSE OF ACTION\\nAfter the problem has been identified, the pilot must\\nevaluate the need to react to it and determine the\\nactions that may be taken to resolve the situation in the\\ntime available. The expected outcome of each possible\\naction should be considered and the risks assessed\\nbefore deciding on a response to the situation.\\nThe pilot determines there is insufficient fuel to reach\\nthe destination, and considers other options, such as\\nturning around and landing at a nearby airport that\\nhas been passed, diverting off course, or landing prior\\nto the destination at an airport on the route. The\\nexpected outcome of each possible action must be\\nconsidered along with an assessment of the risks\\ninvolved. After studying the aeronautical chart, the\\npilot concludes that there is an airport that has fuel-\\ning services within the remaining fuel range along the\\nroute. The time expended for the extra fuel stop is a\\nworthwhile investment to ensure a safe completion of\\nthe flight.\\nDEFINITIONS\\nAERONAUTICAL DECISION MAKING (ADM) is a systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently \\ndetermine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances.\\nATTITUDE is a personal motivational predisposition to respond to persons, situations, or events in a given manner that can, \\nnevertheless, be changed or modified through training as sort of a mental shortcut to decision making.\\nATTITUDE MANAGEMENT is the ability to recognize hazardous attitudes in oneself and the willingness to modify them as \\nnecessary through the application of an appropriate antidote thought.\\nHEADWORK is required to accomplish a conscious, rational thought process when making decisions. Good decision making \\ninvolves risk identification and assessment, information processing, and problem solving.\\nJUDGMENT is the mental process of recognizing and analyzing all pertinent information in a particular situation, a rational \\nevaluation of alternative actions in response to it, and a timely decision on which action to take.\\nPERSONALITY is the embodiment of personal traits and characteristics of an individual that are set at a very early age and \\nextremely resistant to change.\\nPOOR JUDGMENT CHAIN is a series of mistakes that may lead to an accident or incident. Two basic principles generally \\nassociated with the creation of a poor judgment chain are: (1) One bad decision often leads to another; and (2) as a string of bad\\ndecisions grows, it reduces the number of subsequent alternatives for continued safe flight. ADM is intended to break the poor \\njudgment chain before it can cause an accident or incident.\\nRISK ELEMENTS IN ADM take into consideration the four fundamental risk elements: the pilot, the aircraft, the environment, and \\nthe type of operation that comprise any given aviation situation.\\nRISK MANAGEMENT is the part of the decision making process which relies on situational awareness, problem recognition, and \\ngood judgment to reduce risks associated with each flight.\\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS is the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four \\nfundamental risk elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight.\\nSKILLS and PROCEDURES are the procedural, psychomotor, and perceptual skills used to control a specific aircraft or its \\nsystems. They are the airmanship abilities that are gained through conventional training, are perfected, and become almost \\nautomatic through experience.\\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT is the personal analysis of the kinds of stress experienced while flying, the application of appropriate \\nstress assessment tools, and other coping mechanisms.\\nCREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (CRM) is the application of team management concepts in the flight deck environment. It \\nwas initially known as cockpit resource management, but as CRM programs evolved to include cabin crews, maintenance \\npersonnel, and others, the phrase crew resource management was adopted. This includes single pilots, as in most general \\naviation aircraft. Pilots of small aircraft, as well as crews of larger aircraft, must make effective use of all available resources; \\nhuman resources, hardware, and information. A current definition includes all groups routinely working with the cockpit crew who\\nare involved in decisions required to operate a flight safely. These groups include, but are not limited to: pilots, dispatchers, cabin\\ncrewmembers, maintenance personnel, and air traffic controllers. CRM is one way of addressing the challenge of optimizing the \\nhuman/machine interface and accompanying interpersonal activities.\\nFigure 16-1.

The decision-making\\nprocess involves an evaluation of each of these risk\\nelements to achieve an accurate perception of the\\nflight situation. [Figure 16-3]\\nOne of the most important decisions that a pilot in\\ncommand must make is the go/no-go decision.\\nEvaluating each of these risk elements can help in\\ndeciding whether a flight should be conducted or con-\\ntinued. Below is a review of the four risk elements and\\nhow they affect decision making regarding the follow-\\ning situations.\\nPilot— A pilot must continually make decisions about\\ncompetency, condition of health, mental and emotional\\nstate, level of fatigue, and many other variables. For\\nexample, a pilot may be called early in the morning to\\nmake a long flight. If a pilot has had only a few hours\\nof sleep and is concerned that the congestion being\\nexperienced could be the onset of a cold, it would be\\nprudent to consider if the flight could be accomplished\\nsafely.\\nA pilot had only 4 hours of sleep the night before. The\\nboss then asked the pilot to fly to a meeting in a city\\n750 miles away. The reported weather was marginal\\nand not expected to improve. After assessing fitness as\\na pilot, it was decided that it would not be wise to make\\nthe flight. The boss was initially unhappy, but later\\nconvinced by the pilot that the risks involved were\\nunacceptable.\\nAirplane— A pilot will frequently base decisions on\\nthe evaluations of the airplane, such as performance,\\nequipment, or airworthiness.\\nDetect the fact that a change has occurred.\\nEstimate the need to counter or react to the change.\\nChoose a desirable outcome for the success of the flight.\\nIdentify actions which could successfully control the change.\\nDo the necessary action to adapt to the change.\\nEvaluate the effect of the action.\\nDECIDE MODEL\\nFigure 16-2. The DECIDE model can provide a framework for\\neffective decision making.\\nRISK ELEMENTS\\nPilot Airplane Environment Operation\\nFactors, such as weather, \\nairport conditions, and the \\navailability of air traffic control \\nservices must be examined.\\nThe airplane's performance, \\nlimitations, equipment, and \\nairworthiness must be deter- \\nmined.\\nThe pilot's fitness to fly must \\nbe evaluated including \\ncompetency in the airplane, \\ncurrency, and flight experience.\\nTo maintain situational awareness, an accurate perception must be \\nattained of how the pilot, airplane, environment, and operation \\ncombine to affect the flight.\\nSituation\\nThe purpose of the flight is a \\nfactor which influences the \\npilot's decision on undertaking \\nor continuing the flight.\\nFigure 16-3. When situationally aware, the pilot has an overview of the total operation and is not fixated on one perceived sig-\\nnificant factor.\\nRisk Elements—The four components of a flight that make up the\\noverall situation.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-4\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content=\"16-5\\nDuring a preflight, a pilot noticed a small amount of oil\\ndripping from the bottom of the cowling. Although the\\nquantity of oil seemed insignificant at the time, the pilot\\ndecided to delay the takeoff and have a mechanic check\\nthe source of the oil. The pilot’s good judgment was\\nconfirmed when the mechanic found that one of the oil\\ncooler hose fittings was loose. \\nEnvironment— This encompasses many elements not\\npilot or airplane related. It can include such factors as\\nweather, air traffic control, navaids, terrain, takeoff and\\nlanding areas, and surrounding obstacles. Weather is\\none element that can change drastically over time and\\ndistance.\\nA pilot was landing a small airplane just after a heavy\\njet had departed a parallel runway. The pilot assumed\\nthat wake turbulence would not be a problem since\\nlandings had been performed under similar circum-\\nstances. Due to a combination of prevailing winds and\\nwake turbulence from the heavy jet drifting across the\\nlanding runway, the airplane made a hard landing. The\\npilot made an error when assessing the flight environ-\\nment.\\nOperation— The interaction between the pilot, air-\\nplane, and the environment is greatly influenced by\\nthe purpose of each flight operation. The pilot must\\nevaluate the three previous areas to decide on the\\ndesirability of undertaking or continuing the flight as\\nplanned. It is worth asking why the flight is being\\nmade, how critical is it to maintain the schedule, and\\nis the trip worth the risks?\\nOn a ferry flight to deliver an airplane from the factory,\\nin marginal weather conditions, the pilot calculated the\\ngroundspeed and determined that the airplane would\\narrive at the destination with only 10 minutes of fuel\\nremaining. The pilot was determined to keep on sched-\\nule by trying to “stretch” the fuel supply instead of\\nlanding to refuel. After landing with low fuel state, the\\npilot realized that this could have easily resulted in an\\nemergency landing in deteriorating weather condi-\\ntions. This was a chance that was not worth taking to\\nkeep the planned schedule.\\nASSESSING RISK\\nExamining National Transportation Safety Board\\n(NTSB) reports and other accident research can help\\nassess risk more effectively. For example, the accident\\nrate during night VFR decreases by nearly 50 percent\\nonce a pilot obtains 100 hours, and continues to\\ndecrease until the 1,000-hour level. The data suggest\\nthat for the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night\\nmight want to establish higher personal limitations than\\nare required by the regulations and, if applicable, apply\\ninstrument flying skills in this environment. [Figure\\n16-4]\\nStudies also indicate the types of flight activities that\\nare likely to result in the most serious accidents. The\\nmajority of fatal general aviation accidents fall under\\nthe categories of takeoff/initial climb, maneuvering\\nflight, approaches, and weather. Delving deeper into\\naccident statistics can provide some important details\\nthat can help in understanding the risks involved with\\nspecific flying situations. For example, maneuvering\\nflight is one of the largest single producers of fatal\\naccidents. In the approach phase, fatal accidents often\\nhappen at night or in IFR conditions. Takeoff/initial\\nclimb accidents frequently are due to the pilot’s lack\\nof awareness of the effects of density altitude on air-\\nplane performance or other improper takeoff planning\\nresulting in loss of control during, or shortly after\\ntakeoff. The majority of weather-related accidents\\noccur after attempted VFR flight into IFR conditions.\\nFACTORS AFFECTING DECISION\\nMAKING\\nIt is important to point out the fact that being familiar\\nwith the decision-making process does not ensure the\\ngood judgment to be a safe pilot. The ability to make\\neffective decisions as pilot in command depends on a\\nnumber of factors. Some circumstances, such as the\\ntime available to make a decision may be beyond a\\npilot’s control. However, one can learn to recognize\\nthose factors that can be managed, and learn skills to\\nimprove decision-making ability and judgment.\\nPILOT SELF-ASSESSMENT\\nThe pilot in command of an airplane is directly\\nresponsible for, and is the final authority as to, the\\noperation of that airplane. To effectively exercise that\\nresponsibility and make effective decisions regarding\\nthe outcome of a flight, a pilot should be aware of per-\\nsonal limitations.

Often, pilots thoroughly check their\\nairplane to determine airworthiness, yet do not evaluate\\ntheir own fitness for flight. Just as a checklist is used\\nwhen preflighting an airplane, a personal checklist based\\non such factors as experience, currency, and comfort level\\ncan help determine if a pilot is prepared for a particular\\nflight. Specifying when refresher training should be\\naccomplished and designating weather minimums\\nthat may be higher than those listed in Title 14 of the\\nCode of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 are\\nelements that may be included on a personal check-\\nlist. In addition to a review of personal limitations,\\nuse the I’M SAFE Checklist to further evaluate fitness\\nfor flight. [Figure 16-5]\\nRECOGNIZING HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES\\nBeing fit to fly depends on more than just a pilot’s\\nphysical condition and recency of experience. For\\nexample, attitude will affect the quality of decisions.\\nAttitude can be defined as a personal motivational\\npredisposition to respond to persons, situations, or\\nevents in a given manner. Studies have identified five\\nhazardous attitudes that can interfere with the ability\\nto make sound decisions and exercise authority prop-\\nerly. [Figure 16-6]\\nHazardous attitudes can lead to poor decision making\\nand actions that involve unnecessary risk. The pilot\\nmust examine decisions carefully to ensure that the\\nchoices have not been influenced by hazardous atti-\\ntudes and be familiar with positive alternatives to\\ncounteract the hazardous attitudes. These substitute\\nattitudes are referred to as antidotes. During a flight\\noperation, it is important to be able to recognize a\\nhazardous attitude, correctly label the thought, and\\nthen recall its antidote. [Figure 16-7]\\nSTRESS MANAGEMENT\\nEveryone is stressed to some degree almost all the\\ntime. A certain amount of stress is good since it keeps\\na person alert and prevents complacency. However,\\neffects of stress are cumulative and, if not coped with\\nadequately, they eventually add up to an intolerable\\nburden. Performance generally increases with the\\nonset of stress, peaks, and then begins to fall off rap-\\nIllness—Do I have any symptoms?\\nMedication—Have I been taking prescription or\\nover-the-counter drugs?\\nStress—Am I under psychological pressure from \\nthe job?

Prior to flight, pilot fitness should be assessed\\nthe same as the airplane’s airworthiness is evaluated.\\nTHE FIVE HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES\\n1.  Anti-Authority:\\n\"Don\\'t tell me.\"\\nThis attitude is found in people who do not like anyone telling them what to do. In a sense, they \\nare saying, \"No one can tell me what to do.\" They may be resentful of having someone tell them \\nwhat to do, or may regard rules, regulations, and procedures as silly or unnecessary. However, it \\nis always your prerogative to question authority if you feel it is in error.\\nThis is the attitude of people who frequently feel the need to do something, anything, immediately. \\nThey do not stop to think about what they are about to do; they do not select the best alternative, \\nand they do the first thing that comes to mind.\\nMany people feel that accidents happen to others, but never to them. They know accidents can \\nhappen, and they know that anyone can be affected. They never really feel or believe that they will \\nbe personally involved. Pilots who think this way are more likely to take chances and increase risk.\\nPilots who are always trying to prove that they are better than anyone else are thinking, \"I can do it \\n–I\\'ll show them.\" Pilots with this type of attitude will try to prove themselves by taking risks in order \\nto impress others. While this pattern is thought to be a male characteristic, women are equally \\nsusceptible.\\nPilots who think, \"What\\'s the use?\" do not see themselves as being able to make a great deal of \\ndifference in what happens to them. When things go well, the pilot is apt to think that it is good luck. \\nWhen things go badly, the pilot may feel that someone is out to get me, or attribute it to bad luck. \\nThe pilot will leave the action to others, for better or worse. Sometimes, such pilots will even go \\nalong with unreasonable requests just to be a \"nice guy.\"\\n2.  Impulsivity:\\n\"Do it quickly.\"\\n3.  Invulnerability:\\n\"It won\\'t happen to me.\"\\n4.  Macho:\\n\"I can do it.\"\\n5.  Resignation:\\n\"What\\'s the use?\"\\nFigure 16-6. The pilot should examine decisions carefully to ensure that the choices have not been influenced by a hazardous\\nattitude.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-6'),\n",

Factors, referred to as\\nstressors, can increase a pilot’s risk of error in the\\ncockpit. [Figure 16-8]\\nThere are several techniques to help manage the accu-\\nmulation of life stresses and prevent stress overload. For\\nexample, including relaxation time in a busy schedule\\nand maintaining a program of physical fitness can help\\nreduce stress levels. Learning to manage time more\\neffectively can help avoid heavy pressures imposed by\\ngetting behind schedule and not meeting deadlines.\\nTake a self-assessment to determine capabilities and\\nlimitations and then set realistic goals. In addition,\\navoiding stressful situations and encounters can help to\\ncope with stress.\\nUSE OF RESOURCES\\nTo make informed decisions during flight operations, a\\npilot must become aware of the resources found both\\ninside and outside the cockpit. Since useful tools and\\nsources of information may not always be readily\\napparent, learning to recognize these resources is an\\nessential part of ADM training. Resources must not\\nonly be identified, but a pilot must develop the skills to\\nevaluate whether there is time to use a particular\\nresource and the impact that its use will have upon the\\nsafety of flight. For example, the assistance of air traf-\\nfic control (ATC) may be very useful if a pilot becomes\\nlost. However, in an emergency situation when action\\nneeds be taken quickly, time may not be available to\\ncontact ATC immediately.\\nINTERNAL RESOURCES\\nInternal resources are found in the cockpit during\\nflight. Since some of the most valuable internal\\nresources are ingenuity, knowledge, and skill, a pilot\\ncan expand cockpit resources immensely by improving\\nthese capabilities. This can be accomplished by fre-\\nquently reviewing flight information publications, such\\nas the CFRs and the Aeronautical Information Manual\\n(AIM), as well as by pursuing additional training.\\nA thorough understanding of all the equipment and sys-\\ntems in the airplane is necessary to fully utilize all\\nresources. For example, advanced navigation and\\nautopilot systems are valuable resources. However, if\\npilots do not fully understand how to use this equipment,\\nAnti-Authority — Although he \\nknows that flying so low to the \\nground is prohibited by the \\nregulations, he feels that the \\nregulations are too restrictive in \\nsome circumstances. \\nImpulsivity — As he is buzzing the \\npark, the airplane does not climb as \\nwell as Steve had anticipated and \\nwithout thinking, Steve pulls back \\nhard on the yoke. The airspeed \\ndrops and the airplane is close to a \\nstalling attitude as the wing brushes \\na power line.\\nInvulnerability — Steve is not \\nworried about an accident since he \\nhas flown this low many times before \\nand he has not had any problems.\\nMacho — Steve often brags to his \\nfriends about his skills as a pilot and \\nhow close to the ground he flies. \\nDuring a local pleasure flight in his \\nsingle-engine airplane, he decides to \\nbuzz some friends barbecuing at a \\nnearby park.\\nResignation — Although Steve \\nmanages to recover, the wing \\nsustains minor damage. Steve thinks \\nto himself, \"It\\'s dangerous for the \\npower company to put those lines so \\nclose to a park. If somebody finds \\nout about this I\\'m going to be in \\ntrouble, but it seems like no matter \\nwhat I do, somebody\\'s always going \\nto criticize.\"\\nFollow the rules. \\nThey are usually \\nright.\\nNot so fast.

The pilot must be able to identify hazardous atti-\\ntudes and apply the appropriate antidote when needed.\\nFigure 16-8. The three types of stressors that can affect a pilot’s performance.\\nSTRESSORS\\nPhysical Stress— Conditions associated with the environment, such as temperature and humidity \\nextremes, noise, vibration, and lack of oxygen.\\nPhysiological Stress—Physical conditions, such as fatigue, lack of physical fitness, sleep loss, \\nmissed meals (leading to low blood sugar levels), and illness.\\nPsychological Stress—Social or emotional factors, such as a death in the family, a divorce, a sick \\nchild, or a demotion at work. This type of stress may also be related to mental workload, such as \\nanalyzing a problem, navigating an aircraft, or making decisions.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-7'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/81.pdf'}, page_content='16-8\\nor they rely on it so much that they become complacent,\\nit can become a detriment to safe flight.\\nChecklists are essential cockpit resources for verifying\\nthat the airplane instruments and systems are checked,\\nset, and operating properly, as well as ensuring that the\\nproper procedures are performed if there is a system\\nmalfunction or in-flight emergency. In addition, the\\nAirplane Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook\\n(AFM/POH), which is required to be carried on board\\nthe airplane, is essential for accurate flight planning\\nand for resolving in-flight equipment malfunctions.\\nOther valuable cockpit resources include current aero-\\nnautical charts and publications, such as the\\nAirport/Facility Directory.\\nPassengers can also be a valuable resource. Passengers\\ncan help watch for traffic and may be able to provide\\ninformation in an irregular situation, especially if they\\nare familiar with flying. A strange smell or sound may\\nalert a passenger to a potential problem. A pilot in com-\\nmand should brief passengers before the flight to make\\nsure that they are comfortable voicing any concerns.\\nEXTERNAL RESOURCES\\nPossibly the greatest external resources during flight\\nare air traffic controllers and flight service specialists.\\nATC can help decrease pilot workload by providing\\ntraffic advisories, radar vectors, and assistance in emer-\\ngency situations. Flight service stations can provide\\nupdates on weather, answer questions about airport\\nconditions, and may offer direction-finding assistance.\\nThe services provided by ATC can be invaluable in\\nenabling a pilot to make informed in-flight decisions.\\nWORKLOAD MANAGEMENT\\nEffective workload management ensures that essential\\noperations are accomplished by planning, prioritizing, and\\nsequencing tasks to avoid work overload. As experience is\\ngained, a pilot learns to recognize future workload\\nrequirements and can prepare for high workload periods\\nduring times of low workload. Reviewing the appropriate\\nchart and setting radio frequencies well in advance of\\nwhen they are needed helps reduce workload as the flight\\nnears the airport. In addition, a pilot should listen to A TIS,\\nASOS, or AWOS, if available, and then monitor the tower\\nfrequency or CTAF to get a good idea of what traffic con-\\nditions to expect. Checklists should be performed well in\\nadvance so there is time to focus on traffic and ATC\\ninstructions. These procedures are especially important\\nprior to entering a high-density traffic area, such as Class\\nB airspace.\\nTo manage workload, items should be prioritized.\\nDuring any situation, and especially in an emergency,\\nremember the phrase “aviate, navigate, and communi-\\ncate.” This means that the first thing the pilot should do\\nis to make sure the airplane is under control. Then\\nbegin flying to an acceptable landing area. Only after\\nthe first two items are assured should the pilot try to\\ncommunicate with anyone.\\nAnother important part of managing workload is\\nrecognizing a work overload situation. The first\\neffect of high workload is that the pilot begins to\\nwork faster. As workload increases, attention cannot\\nbe devoted to several tasks at one time, and the pilot\\nmay begin to focus on one item. When a pilot\\nbecomes task saturated, there is no awareness of\\ninputs from various sources, so decisions may be\\nmade on incomplete information, and the possibility\\nof error increases. [Figure 16-9]\\nWhen becoming overloaded, stop, think, slow down,\\nand prioritize. It is important to understand options that\\nmay be available to decrease workload. For example,\\ntasks such as locating an item on a chart or setting a\\nradio frequency may be delegated to another pilot or\\npassenger; an autopilot, if available, may be used; or\\nATC may be enlisted to provide assistance.\\nSITUATIONAL AWARENESS\\nSituational awareness is the accurate perception of the\\noperational and environmental factors that affect the air-\\nplane, pilot, and passengers during a specific period of\\ntime. Maintaining situational awareness requires an\\nunderstanding of the relative significance of these factors\\nand their future impact on the flight. When situationally\\naware, the pilot has an overview of the total operation\\nand is not fixated on one perceived significant factor.\\nSome of the elements inside the airplane to be considered\\nare the status of airplane systems, and also the pilot and\\npassengers. In addition, an awareness of the environmen-\\ntal conditions of the flight, such as spatial orientation of\\nthe airplane, and its relationship to terrain, traffic,\\nweather, and airspace must be maintained.\\nTo maintain situational awareness, all of the skills\\ninvolved in aeronautical decision making are used.

At this point, an\\nemergency or distraction could overtax pilot capabilities,\\ncausing an accident.\\nCh 16.qxd  10/24/03  8:49 AM  Page 16-8'),\n",

A clear assessment of the status of\\nnavigation equipment can be obtained through\\nworkload management, and establishing a produc-\\ntive relationship with ATC can be accomplished by\\neffective resource use.\\nOBSTACLES TO MAINTAINING SITUATIONAL\\nAWARENESS\\nFatigue, stress, and work overload can cause a pilot to\\nfixate on a single perceived important item rather than\\nmaintaining an overall awareness of the flight situation.\\nA contributing factor in many accidents is a distraction\\nthat diverts the pilot’s attention from monitoring the\\ninstruments or scanning outside the airplane. Many\\ncockpit distractions begin as a minor problem, such as a\\ngauge that is not reading correctly, but result in accidents\\nas the pilot diverts attention to the perceived problem\\nand neglects to properly control the airplane.\\nComplacency presents another obstacle to maintaining\\nsituational awareness. When activities become routine,\\nthere is a tendency to relax and not put as much effort into\\nperformance. Like fatigue, complacency reduces a pilot’s\\neffectiveness in the cockpit. However, complacency is\\nharder to recognize than fatigue, since everything is per-\\nceived to be progressing smoothly. For example, a pilot\\nhas not bothered to calculate the CG of the airplane\\nbecause it has never been a problem. Without the pilot\\nrealizing it, a passenger loads a heavy piece of equipment\\nin the nose baggage compartment. The pilot notices severe\\nnose heaviness during climb-out after takeoff, and finds it\\nnecessary to use full nose-up trim to maintain level flight.\\nAs the pilot flares for landing, the elevator reaches the stop\\nwithout raising the nose enough, and the nose-first land-\\ning results in loss of the nose gear and extensive damage\\nto the airplane.\\nOPERATIONAL PITFALLS\\nThere are a number of classic behavioral traps into which\\npilots have been known to fall. Pilots, particularly those\\nwith considerable experience, as a rule, always try to\\ncomplete a flight as planned, please passengers, and\\nmeet schedules. The basic drive to meet or exceed goals\\ncan have an adverse effect on safety, and can impose an\\nunrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful\\nconditions. These tendencies ultimately may bring about\\npractices that are dangerous and often illegal, and may\\nlead to a mishap. A pilot will develop awareness and\\nlearn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls through\\neffective ADM training. [Figure 16-10]\\nPeer Pressure—Poor decision making may be based upon an emotional response to peers, rather than evaluating a situation \\nobjectively.\\nMind Set—A pilot displays mind set through an inability to recognize and cope with changes in a given situation. \\nGet-There-Itis—This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a \\ndisregard for any alternative course of action.\\nDuck-Under Syndrome—A pilot may be tempted to make it into an airport by descending below minimums during an \\napproach. There may be a belief that there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or a pilot may want to \\nadmit that the landing cannot be completed and a missed approach must be initiated.\\nScud Running—This occurs when a pilot tries to maintain visual contact with the terrain at low altitudes while instrument \\nconditions exist.\\nContinuing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) into Instrument Conditions—Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles \\nmay occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can be even more dangerous if the pilot is not \\ninstrument-rated or current.\\nGetting Behind the Aircraft—This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant \\nstate of surprise at what happens next may be exhibited when the pilot is getting behind the aircraft.\\nLoss of Positional or Situational Awareness—In extreme cases, when a pilot  gets behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or \\nsituational awareness may result. The pilot may not know the aircraft's geographical location, or may be unable to recognize \\ndeteriorating circumstances.\\nOperating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves —Ignoring minimum fuel reserve requirements is generally the result of \\noverconfidence, lack of flight planning, or disregarding applicable regulations.\\nDescent Below the Minimum En Route Altitude—The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the \\nen route portion of an IFR flight.\\nFlying Outside the Envelope—The assumed high performance capability of a particular aircraft may cause a mistaken belief \\nthat it can meet the demands imposed by a pilot's overestimated flying skills. \\nNeglect of Flight Planning, Preflight Inspections, and Checklists—A pilot may rely on short- and long-term memory, regular \\nflying skills, and familiar routes instead of established procedures and published checklists. This can be particularly true of\\nexperienced pilots.\\nOPERATIONAL PITFALLS\\nFigure 16-10.
